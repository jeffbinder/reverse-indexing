If the herrings are cured with British salt, it will stand thus, viz.
Bounty, as beforeL.0 14 11¾
But if to this bounty, the duty on two bushels of Scotch salt,
at 1s. 6d. per bushel, supposed to be the quantity, at a
medium, used in curing each barrel, is added, viz.   0   3 0

the bounty on each barrel will amount toL.0 17 11¾


And when buss herrings are entered for home consumption in Scotland, and
pay the shilling a-barrel of duty, the bounty stands thus, to wit, as
beforeL.0 12  3
From which the 1s. a-barrel is to be deducted   0   1  0

L.0 11  3¾
But to that there is to be added again, the duty of the
foreign salt used in curing a barrel of herrings, viz.   0 12  6

So that the premium allowed for each barrel of herrings
entered for home consumption isL.1    3  9¾


If the herrings are cured with British salt, it will stand as
follows, viz.
Bounty on each barrel brought in by the busses, as aboveL.0 12  3¾
From which deduct the 1s. a-barrel, paid at the time they are
entered for home consumption   0   1 0

L.0 11  3¾
But if to the bounty, the duty on two bushels of Scotch salt,
at 1s. 6d. per bushel, supposed to be the quantity, at a
medium, used in curing each barrel, is added, viz.   0   3 0

the premium for each barrel entered for home consumption will beL.0 14  3¾



Though the loss of duties upon herrings exported cannot, perhaps, properly
be considered as bounty, that upon herrings entered for home consumption
certainly may.
