THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 1

The number of people who are maintained at the command of the proprietor, is always in proportion to that part of the annual produce which is necessary for maintaining and supplying them. If the whole produce were sufficient, they would not be maintained at all, and the proprietors might not be able to pay their rent, together with the profits which their stock affords them.

The number and subsistence, therefore of the proprietors are always regulated by this part of the produce only, or, what comes nearly to the like notion, by the proportion of the produce of the one part to that of the other, the neat produce.

If this neat produce should happen either to be greater, or to be less than what is requisite for maintaining, either all, or some part, either of all or of any particular proprietors; this excess or deficiency, in the one case, would immediately raise, or depress, the rent, in another case it would raise or depress the profits. It is the disproportion between what the landlord requires of the land, and what the farmer can afford to give, which occasions this disproportion, and regulates the competition among all those whose industry can either supply, maintain, or consume the greater part of that which is over and above the necessary for maintaining all the rest. It is the excess or defect of what can supply, or be afforded only, that occasions the competition, which, in turn, regulates the wages and profits. It is this competition, therefore, and the competition between different sorts of labour, which determines, in each society, what sort of rude produce is to go to the ground and be replaced, and in each country, what share in this produce belongs to the different orders of people who live on the land, in what proportion, and in what circumstances, each order contributes to its maintenance and consumption, according as it is either more or less favoured, and according as the land and its inhabitants happen either to be more, or less, thriving, in comparison with the greater part of their neighbours. The proportion, for example, of the land and labour of England, to that of Scotland and Wales (which are not, like England and Holland, divided among many great nations, but divided equally), is very different from what the neighbouring countries of France, Italy, and Hungary are to one other, and from that of all the countries which border upon England.


 CHAP. IV.

OF WAGE-GRAIN.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 2

The wages of labour, therefore, must always be sufficient to replace, in the condition in which they are paid, the stock which employs and powers them.

But though it sometimes happens that a particular set or order of people have more stock than can be employed at their proper work, and consequently that they are forced to sell what they produce for a much lower price, than what would otherwise take place; yet if this be done only by the negligence, profuseness or ignorance of the masters, who are too weak or ignorant to employ them properly, it cannot last longer than a few weeks, perhaps no more than a few months, before it begins to do so, or even to cause much inconveniency.
The number and productive powers of the different labourers must always be in proportion to the stock upon which they are placed, and to their own abilities. If they are more numerous than this stock can maintain and employ properly, they must be maintained and employed by the rich, at a higher price. But the rich are not likely, without some considerable encouragement, to employ the great body of their servants in such a manner as to increase the quantity of their own produce, but rather to diminish its quality. They will, therefore endeavour, in every way possible, to diminish, as far as they possibly can, their share of that produce which remains to them after defraying the expense, both of their own maintenance, and of their own employment.

It seldom, however, happens that the owners or overseers of any particular set or order of labourers are themselves sufficiently skilled in the management of that particular set, nor sufficiently intelligent to foresee the effects, even though the accidents of their own management should frequently occasion some of them. It frequently happens, indeed (and it happened in all those different countries mentioned above, and which were represented by Mr Locke as thriving upon the exchange of their rude produce for manufactured produce), that a particular set of artificers has, besides their stock of instruments and materials of manufacture (which is generally much larger in proportion to their small capital than the whole stock of artificERS employed about the greater part of manufactures, and in all arts, from which the profits naturally compensate the wages of their employment) the knowledge of many useful, and even profitable arts; such as the management and use of fire-arms and of engines for raising, carrying, and conveying heavy goods. But though this set of artificers, even though its members were properly

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 3

paid according to their respective skill and experience, might not be able to sell all their work as fast, nor even at its real value, as a single person can do it by the assistance of a team of men. If they did not live in towns, their goods would not always be brought to them from distant places. They would have to bring them from all those distant places, in order to have any chance of selling them for any price. The whole quantity brought to market would necessarily increase in proportion to this increase in the number of artificers. The demand for all the work which was then being done in those distant places might increase in a still higher proportion, because it could be brought thither cheaper than before; because the workmen could find it so easily to employ themselves. The whole quantity of the necessaries and comforts of life which the society had at that time purchased with its own money might increase in the same proportion; and this increase in their real wealth, the increase of the annual produce of the land and labour, the real revenue and wealth of all their inhabitants, might be no greater than before.

It would not be necessary that all the artificers in the country, however great their skill, should live within the town, or even within the country. The inhabitants of every considerable town might be obliged, for the sake of saving the trouble and expense of carriage and distribution, to confine their trade within the city limits; to employ all the artificers whom their particular circumstances rendered suitable to that trade; to give them the best security, and consequently the greatest freedom and security in performing that work; and in return to get from the country a quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies which their own industry was capable either to produce, or to purchase. The whole quantity brought to market would thereby, in the long run increase in the proportion to the number of inhabitants, the same thing which the division and combination, or, more properly, the exclusion of foreigners from particular trades and occupations in a town necessarily increases in that of the inhabitants of that town; and though, by this change, some of the artificers in the country should be deprived either of the free exercise or communication of their trade, the rest will find it easier and cheaper to come to them.

The extraordinary demand of a great country, such, for example, as France, might require a like separation of the greater part, perhaps of all the artificERS OF that great country,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 4

from their proper business. The machines and instruments of trade which are invented and improved during a long course, may, perhaps, in some cases, require this separation; but they seldom do so. The artificers of any particular country are necessarily attached, either by their profession or by their situation, to the employment which is nearest to their own heart. Their industry is, in general speaking, carried on with more fidelity, steadiness, steadier hand, and a better understanding of the nature, use, and operation, of every instrument, machine, or instrument of trade, in which they have any part, than if carried upon some distant, more distant, more uncertain employment. They are generally, therefore, more attentive to their own business, more attentive to the instructions of those who are entrusted with it; and, consequently, more disposed to adopt, when properly instructed, the better plan of employing a capital in a particular way, than those who, though entrusted by their masters with some share, have not so intimate a connection with the employment which is to employ it. The division, therefore of labour, by which the industry of artificers is commonly subdivided, tends more to improve their skill and understanding than to separate their labour. The machines which are invented, improved, and extended by artificors of every sort, are, upon this account more likely to become the property of private people, who can better employ them, and, consequently, to improve their use and application, than those which, being the property of merchants, artificors, and manufacturers of some sort, are more likely to be neglected or misused. The machines, therefore, which are the offspring, not only of artificers, but of merchants and manufacturers, tend, upon this account, not only more to divide the industry, not only more slowly and insensiblely, than it might have been otherwise divided, but more likely, too, to be abused, to be perniciously employed in producing goods which cannot be sold, or which, when sold at home are exchanged, do not bring back any revenue to the owners of them. The machines, accordingly, which are made for facilitating the mechanical employment, of the workmen of all different countries, are of all the most perishable, and consequently of all the most liable to abuse.

It was the ingenious and industrious spirit of the French, who first invented, or rather refined, the machinery for executing, without the aid either of human

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 5

industry, nor of any other machine, the different parts of the operation of an agio or incline, which enables a plough to turn a field of good grass into a field of rich crops.
The French have always had a great deal of ingenuity in all sorts of machines, which facilitate, or even render unnecessary the labour of a great number; as well as in the management of great quantities.

They have been the inventors and manufacturers, in all countries, of all sorts and species, of machines which assist, and sometimes replace, labour; as well as of many other instruments of trade which are useful only in combination with those machines; such as inclosures and drains. The most important of all these machines is, I believe, the plough; and the most useful instrument it has been imagined for executing, was the inclosure, or the hedge which it made between two fields. In ancient times, the inclosure was generally of timber. The Romans, and some of our northern ancestors, appear to have considered it as the most proper instrument for dividing the field, or, what comes to the same thing, for making the most proper division, between the husbandry of cattle, the raising and reaping of grain, &amps;C;&amp;c; the raising and preparing of the food necessary for the people, and which, as the produce of land, is the common fund from whence all others are drawn, the husbandry of cattle being the principal, and the raising of grain being only a subordinate employment, of which the instruments are much more simple.

In the present agricultural state of Europe (which is, in reality, but the progress of an agricultural state), it seems to be a maxim that the greater part of the improvements of land should be made by machines, which assist, and in some measure replace, human industry, and the industry of the farmer himself; machines of a kind, however (which, in the progress of improvement, must always advance more and better than any man's skill or ingenuity can improve them for), of such an invention and construction, as to render the operation as simple as the circumstances and situation of each farmer may require. Such are, I believe (though this doctrine has never yet been verified by experience) the plough and the harrow, and the tread-mill, and other improvements of this kind.

The plow and the horse, though originally employed in the husbandries,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 6

have since that time been so much improved in their mechanical arrangement as almost to leave no room for any human agency in managing or directing them; and the most laborious operations of husbandry are at present performed by machines.

But the division and distribution of the labour of society, in its different periods of improvement, is not always uniform. In some countries the husbandry is stationary; in others it advances; while in some, the cultivation of the soil, by means of the most advantageous combinations, and by the most advantageous division and distribution of labour, gradually replaces the stock which is employed about it in a more improved manner, than that stock can be of much service in maintaining it. In France, the greater part, I am assured, both of the cultivated and of the uncultivated lands, are not capable either of producing the corn which constitutes, at present in the market of England, a considerable article in the subsistence, even of a very well-to-do family; or even of supplying the consumption, either of the house or of the farmhouse; and this state of the French agriculture, I believe, will be found everywhere in the commercial world, in all the countries of Europe where there is a tolerable security, either to property or to person. In Holland, the same state of the country, it has already been observed, produces very much the corn which constitutes the subsistence of a very rich family; though, in proportion to their extent, this crop is not of so much value. In France, the cultivation, it must always be observed, is much superior to that in Holland, both in quantity, and consequently in value. In England, therefore, it must be supposed that, though corn constitutes a considerable article in the subsistence of the people, its value does so too by the assistance of the stock and labour employed about it, which, in the one country, consists almost altogether in the rude produce of the land, while, in the second country (England), consists, with very few exceptions, chiefly of manufactures and the manufactured commodities of the East India Company, of the materials of linen and woollen manufacture.

In countries where there is a more advanced agriculture, the division and distribution of labour, though it may have advanced to a certain degree of perfection in every particular branch of business, is not uniform, but is liable sometimes to very sudden changes, and sometimes to very slow progress, according as the circumstances of each individual, or particular set

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 7

or order, happen to render the different parts either useful or unuseful, or to require different degrees or kinds of industry, from those employed in the greater part.

The natural advantages of education, acquired by frequent practice in the particular trades to which one belongs, and which he has frequently been taught, are, the more he improves himself, the less likely he is either to be employed in a trade which he does not like, or even, in the ordinary case, to be able to earn the wages of such a trade without any particular attention, either to acquire or improve those natural advantages.


 ART. III.

Of the Unproductive Classes of People, or Those that are Not Producing any Rent, but are Expended for His Benefit, as the Stockholders of Stock are in Great Companies, or the Governors in all well governed States.
The unproductive classes are those, which are not productive, either in the direct or indirect sense; that is to produce, either something for their own use or consumption; or something which, being consumed, produces no further effect.

The unproductive classes are, in this manner, divided among the four following classes.

First, are the productive poor, or those whose whole labour only produces something which they themselves use or consume. The unprosperous poor produce nothing for their own use or for that of any other human being, but live by the wages or profit of their own labour; as the idle rich produce nothing which can repay the expense which they have occasion for.

The productive poor, therefore are not, strictly speaking (though in the present book I use this word in its strictest sense, and mean, by it only, those whose labour only produces something useful for its owner), producers of rent, but merely those whose labour produces something useful for another. They may, however, in the actual circumstances of a particular society, and in particular occupations, produce something which produces a revenue, though it may not, in its whole nature and extent, repay the expense which they have occasion for. The unproductive poor are, therefore, the real, though perhaps not the principal cause, of the wealth of every great nation.

Secondly, are the productive poor, or those whose labour adds to something else useful for the owner's use or consumption, or for the conveniencies and conveniencies of life. The productive poor are the great, though not necessarily the sole

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 8

, consumers of every other produce. They are the labourer, the artificer, the manufacturer, the farmer; the undertaker, the farmer of his farm, and, in the same way the undertaker, the farmer of the lands which he cultivates. In proportion to their revenue they have, therefore, an equal right to the surplus produce, or what is over and above their own consumption. Their revenue, too, is in this manner necessarily regulated, in some measure at least, according to the nature of the employment which is given to it.

The revenue arising from labour, and which is in this manner the source and origin of all other revenues (which are in reality derived from a fund originally drawn and destined for the payment of that revenue), is in the same manner divisible, and may be distributed either among all the individuals who are directly employed in the service of the society; or among all the individuals whom it is intended should be maintained in the service of it.

The maintenance of a single person, whether labourer, artificer or manufacturer, naturally divides itself into three portions. The wages of labour belong altogether, first to him who performs that service; and, secondly, to his employer who advances to him the expense of his maintenance, or the money or goods which he consumes while he is employed in performing it. Thirdly, and lastly, to him who, by performing that service, contributes either to maintain, or to procure for himself the means of maintaining some other labourers or workmen; and to this he adds his profit, that is, his wages and the profits of the employer, together with the rent of his own dwelling, and the interest of his own capital.


 CHAP II.

OF THE RISE AND DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITAL.

 The division and distribution of revenue, it is to be observed, are in this manner naturally determined by the original purposes for which they were originally bestowed; and are in the same degree of simplicity, regularity and necessity, whether the whole or any particular part of them be applied towards those different purposes, or whether they be employed altogether in the maintenance of labour.

Capitals are increased by improvement, or, what comes to nearly the same thing in all cases; by employing more labour in any particular branch, than the natural generation, by taking away the necessity of rearing, and consequently of caring, a large family, and consequently of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 9

supporting such a number as would otherwise maintain and educate them. In the progress of improvement, every new improvement necessarily occasions a greater capital being added to those which had before been employed in the cultivation and improvement of the lands which produced the original produce, and every new demand for that original production, a greater capital must immediately be raised to provide that demand, and thereby facilitate and abate that further improvement, or to supply that further demand. The whole produce of the lands of the society, however (which in the rude state of society is altogether incapable of supporting any great number), must, in this manner, gradually grow greater and greater, and, in due time, become capable of maintaining and instructing, not only many greater numbers of people, but a still greater and a still greater variety. The increase in the productive powers, too, which is continually occasioned, either by improvement, or by the extension of the commerce and manufactures which support and augment the wealth and revenue of the country, necessarily occasions a like increase in the productive powers of those which are originally incapable of supporting any great multitude; a continual and uninterrupted increase which cannot fail, in due time, to raise the whole of those original produce into the proportions in to which it can maintain, and educate, and bring up, an infinite multitude of children, who are all capable of supporting and instructing, and of contributing, one to another, as great a quantity as they themselves are capable.

The want of a constant supply of the materials, or of some other means by which the labourer might be enabled to supply himself, without the employment of any capital, is perhaps the greatest obstacle, both to the progress of improvement, and to the establishment of the arts of war, which, it has been said by Mr. Locke, could have no other cause, than because men are naturally disposed to invade one other.

But though men, like all other animals, have no constant means of supplying one another, they do, in general, possess a certain quantity of the materials of life which they themselves produce, in sufficient quantity to supply themselves with them. They generally have a sufficient stock, too, of provisions and materials of their own manufacture, which they may frequently dispose, without the intervention of any other person, of using and enjoying in the way they think proper, or even in that way in common.


 CHAP II.

OF THE NATURE AND NATURITY OF CIVIL SOC

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 10

IETIES, OF WHICH A PARTICULAR PART WAS FORMED UPON THE REPRODUCT OF LAND; AND OF WHEAT AND CORN.


The whole produce, either of land or labour, naturally belongs to the society in which it can best be put into motion, or, in other words, into the hands of the persons who are best qualified to employ and employ it, according to the natural distribution of things among men and women. But the whole produce of the land and of the labour of every particular country must always bear a certain proportion to the whole produce of all the land and labour of that country; or the whole annual produce must always be sufficient to replace the capital employed in raising it. If it does not bear that proper proportion it cannot well be expected that any part, either either of the capital or of the labour, employed in cultivation should afterwards bear any. It must be replaced either by a profit upon the capital employed in cultivating the land, or by the wages and profits of the labour which immediately employs that capital; by the one or by the other of those two sorts or species of capital, and by the wages of the labour which immediately replaces it.

If, by means of a tax upon the rent of corn, a part of that produce is to be paid away as bountIES to farmers and landlords, it will be more for the advantage, it is probable, of the landlord than if it were paid away in kind, in corn, cattle, &amp;c.; because the landlord, being thus relieved of the expense which would attend a tax of this kind upon his own land, will have the surplus produce of the landlord's land augmented in its natural fertility. The bounty will naturally increase more or less in value as the price rises, till at last the bounty ceases to be worth any part, whatever be its actual value, of what it was before. But if, by the same act of parliament, the bounty is to be paid away, either in kind, as corn and cattle, in money or bullocks; in some measure at least, as a part of the revenue which the sovereign derives from his own lands, the natural fertility and abundance, either in their cultivated or uncared-for state, must necessarily be much diminished by such an act. It must, too, diminish the real revenue which he has over-and above his necessary expenses to pay out of that revenue. It will

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 11

be found that in every period, both the coinage and the plate of the goldsmiths, have gradually advanced, not only in quantity, but, in all the different qualities of which they are capable, till at last, after many revolutions in this direction, the whole has been brought to a level, or has become perfectly equal to the standard of the times. In the present times the gold coin is not worth more than twenty shillings the ounce, and it was so, not long ago; and though it is said by the author of The Currency of France, that at the end of the fifth century, when the coin of the kingdom contained about six ounces of gold, it was reckoned worth between thirty and forty pounds sterling. But in the fifteenth, and for several subsequent centuries, it was not worth less, but, as the value and quantity of the other parts of the gold coin gradually increased, its weight and fineness were improved in a much greater proportion than its value and quantity did in the course of those five or six hundred years; its finess, for example, in the twelfth, 13th, and 14 th centuries, was very nearly equal, or very near to equal, that of the present day. In the same period the plate of all sorts, both plain and coloured, was improved much more than their quantity, in the same proportion, or in a still greater proportion, than their value. In the present times, when we compare either a plate of plain gold with that of fine, the one may scarce appear worth the wearing, whereas, at a very distant period, when it was worth the wearing of fine, its real price would probably have made it equal or superior to it. In those ancient and rude states which preceded the discovery of the American mines, when the labouring poor could not bring their own work to perfection, it would probably not be necessary for the sovereign to attend to the improvement of their workmen's plate, or even to that part of it which belonged to himself. It would probably be sufficient, for his security, to leave them their own private plate.


In every period of the progress of improvement in arts and manufactures, both the demand for and supply to those arts are continually changing, according to the variations both in their actual produce and their demand. As their real price, the quantity of their respective materials and finished work, increases in proportion as their quality increases, the quantity which can annually

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 12

be exchanged for them must likewise increase with their quality. The quantity of the one, therefore (for the quality is always relative to that of what is sold, and is regulated by the same laws which regulate its quantity), must increase in a still higher degree, and that of both must be in an equal or a still higher. But though this increase in their respective values may, no doubt (for there can be no certain certainty about it), take some time, and be very slow and gradual; yet, as they increase gradually, so they must, at last and in the end, arrive at the same or a like conclusion.

It may perhaps be doubted whether the increase in the real value of silver, in consequence either, of the improvement of the mines which produced it, or, perhaps more likely, of that improvement itself, has ever had time enough to produce this like and equal conclusion in the prices both 

¾ ¾


The increase of their respective prices has not always been equally rapid. In some countries, the increase in the value of silver, though very great, has, at the very same time been quite sudden, as in Holland in 1664, when, by a law which put an absolute stop to the trade, all the old smelts of the greater part of Europe were put out from under their own market, to become open only through a small port in the country. In other countries it seems to have taken place gradually, but at the same time very suddenly. The real value of silver in Spain has, since the discovery of the mines in America, increased in an average of four and five per cent. every twelve or fifteen years, or, according as the mines of Potosi are better or worse worked; that of the other metals has increased in an average, not four or five per cent. each twelve or fifteen years, but in a much more rapid manner, according to what is called the average annual increase, or in the course of twenty-one centuries. The Spanish mines, accordingly, which produce gold as well as silver, produce it much faster than the American mines which do not, or at least which produce it not equally. The increase of their respective prices, therefore, has been much greater or smaller, in proportion, not only both of the improvements which have taken place in the Spanish mines of gold, and of those which have taken place in those of other metals; and of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 13

those which, in consequence of these improvements have taken place in the mines of gold, but also of the continual additions of new productions of all kinds, to the stock of the society, in every part either of Europe, Asia or America, in which the Spaniards have any settlements, whether at Acapulco or Manilla. The money price of labour has been continually rising or falling in proportion to this increase of the stock of the society.

The money price of provisions, too, though it has fallen somewhat in proportion to the increase of stock, has risen a little in proportion to the diminuance either of the demand for those provisions, or of the quantity which could easily be disposed of.
The demand for labour, as it has been increasing during the course of the present century, has increased more or lessee considerably, in proportion, not to the increase of the stock employed in producing it; but to that increase, perhaps more to the latter than to either of those two events, and, in this respect at least, to the increase in the number of menial servants. In the year 1636, there were employed in the service of King William the 5,000 men who carried on the great work of building and repairing the bridges of London. In the year 1662, there were in the service of Queen Anne, and, in proportion to what had happened since that time, in that of King Charles I., and in that of King William the Third, 4,800 such men. In the same time, the number of working days in the year has increased from eighty-four hundred to two thousand eight-and twenty, which, in the service of the five most famous sovereign families of England (that of Lancaster, York, Lancashires and Ruddiman), would, according

The price of provisions in England has, during this century (1660-1680

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 14

), fallen considerably below what it had been about 1650. It is at present, I believe, about three and four times lower than that of the beginning, and it is not likely, in the course of a century or two more, to come much lower, for the following reason.

In those times, the ordinary profits made by farming stock were not only much lower, but they varied much from season to season, according as different accidents happened to render the crop either more, less or equal in quantity. The price of provisions was generally higher in summer and lower during the winter. The scarcity occasioned, therefore, sometimes by an extraordinary dew, or sometimes by some other cause, sometimes by a famine and sometimes by an epidemic, occasioned a very considerable rise in their price, which, though not always compensated, yet, in most years at least, exceeded the ordinary profits of agriculture. In the scarcity of the late war, in 1672, and again in the late war of 1701, both times during the minority, the price of provisions was very high; in 1673 during the minority, in 1674 during the minority of Charles II., during that of James II.; and in 1702, in 1703, in 1704 and in the French war which began in 1712, both times in that of his son and successor, the prince regent; so that the high prices of these wars must have arisen altogether from such causes.

During the continuance of the two last war, in 1708 and during the minority of George III., the price of provisions did not, upon any occasion rise higher than what had usually taken places during these two last wars. In the course of a century, therefore (1707-1820), it must have fallen a good deal below what it had risen about the middle of the century. It is not, however, likely, during this century (or for some time after it), either the scarcity occasioning the fall of prices in 1672, or the greater plenty which has taken place since the fall of the war, to raise it above what it has fallen about the middle of the last century, for two reasons, first, the increase of the produce, in consequence of improved tillage, and, secondly, the diminution of that which is owing, partly, to new methods of cultivation and improvement, and partly, to the gradual reduction of the quantity, of which, the greater part being already

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 15

consumed, there is not much more to be produced. In 1722, the average money-price of the four most important sorts of grain in the British market was as follows:

Whey, at 6s. the bushel; oatmeal, 6d.; oatmeal, at 3d.; malt and hops, 6d.; barley, 8d.; oats, at 3d.; barley, 8d. The average money-rent of all these four sorts of grain in 1721 and 1723 was, one year, 4d. and, another, 3½ d.; that of all other sorts, 3d. and that of malt and hop, 2d.

In consequence, too, of the great prosperity which has been enjoyed in Great Britain, and of its having obtained the exclusive privilege of exporting to all nations the surplus of the corn laws of Holland, a great deal more corn is likely to come into competition, than would otherwise have done so. The price, therefore, must, for a considerable while, be somewhat higher, than it otherwise would be, and the competition must be somewhat less than it otherwise would be.
The price of wheat has, during the course of this century, fallen about two-thirds lower than in its former state. The proportion between its average money-price and the average of the four preceding years has been the same; but that between the average of the two last years and that which preceded it is said to have sunk about a third lower than it had been in 1722, and to have risen somewhat in 1724. The average of 1722, accordingly, was 6s. 6¼d. the bushel. In consequence, therefore, of the extraordinary prosperity which has been enjoyed in Great Britain during these ten years, the proportion between its average money-price, which is the same now as it was in 1722 (6s 6½d. or 3¼ d. the bushe), and the average of those five preceding years, will, during a considerable time, probably be the same as it had always been before; and it will, at the same rate of subsistence, afford a still greater rent.

But though the proportion between the ordinary money-rent of all these different crops, and the average money-rent of corn, has sunk considerably, that between that of barley and that of wheat, and that between those which are subject to the bounty of 1736 and those

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 16

which are subject to it still further; yet the bounty still continues, by different artifices, to give some advantage in the foreign markets to those of barley, and even, upon some occasions, even to those of wheat. The price of wheat, indeed (wheat is a vegetable, and, like other vegetable produce of rude soil, is not fit for exportation, except when raised upon improved land), is so much below what is suitable to its real value, as not only to discourage, as it certainly does, its cultivation, but, by rendering its price too high for home use and application (for it is unfit even for that), to discourage its further improvement. But the price of barley, though not so low, has not yet been lowered so low. It is not, indeed, fit even to be exported; and, as the bounty continues to be given in the British market, the exorbitant prices paid in the Dutch market, are probably, in the present circumstances of Europe, somewhat less than they otherwise would have been, and must have been somewhat lower in the times immediately preceding 1764, and in those preceding 1755, the commencement of this century's great crop, than they actually are, and may have continued to be, for many successive seasons, notwithstanding the extraordinary bounty of the Dutch king.

The money rent which is given in the foreign markets, for corn and cattle, has likewise sunk considerably, in consequence both of this bounty, and of several other regulations which have been enacted for the encouragement and security, not only to agriculture, but, more indirectly, to all manufactures and commerce. In the year 1764, a duty of five shillings upon every ton of wheat exported was imposed, in order to raise the value of our foreign coin. This duty has, since 1764, been augmented to ten, and to fifteen shilling the ton. In the years preceding 1764 (for 1764 began the first campaign of our present King George III.), a duty, equal to one-fourth part only, of this tax, was imposed upon the ton of English wool exported. The greater part of the other duties of customs have likewise been augmented, and a greater proportion of them have been imposed at a higher duty, or with an additional duty.
The encouragement given to agriculture, by the bounty, and to all the manufactures and foreign commerce, by the different duties which have been laid upon them, has probably been more important than the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 17

one which has just now come into question, in increasing the quantity of gold and Silver. The bounties and other encourages to the cultivation of land have been so much extorted from the farmers, as, without them, their capitals might not, in ordinary times, have been able to maintain such large herds of animals. But the bounty and other encouragements, by rendering the land dearer in the market of the farmer, enable the farmer to raise the price of the corn he consumes above what it would otherwise be in that market, so much more than it enables the farmer either to raise that price or to keep it down. In the end, therefore, the bounty, by raising both the price of corn and that of cattle, necessarily tends to raise the real price of all those productions, to make a greater part of the produce of the land than before, or to pay a greater rent to those landlords who can either sell their produce at a greater profit, and thus increase the revenue of all the inhabitants of England, or to buy it at a greater profit, in order that they may be able to sell it again. It must, therefore, be advantageous both to the landlord and the farmer, in proportion to their respective abilities, to have this greater quantity of their produce sold in the home market.

But though the bounty raises, at the same time, the real value, both of silver and of corn in the home market, it does not seem capable of raising the rate at home which is necessary for bringing it thither. If it raised the price at the farm, the farmer could always get the full value of his silver, without exposing himself, even for a day or two, to any risk, of losing it by spoil or other accidents. The farmer, however (and this is what I mean), would probably, upon such occasions, be much obliged to the bounty. It might enable the landlord to pay him for his land, instead of the rent, which would naturally fall upon him. But it would not enable him to raise that rent. It might, indeed, enable the latter to pay him for a part only of the labour, which he employed in raising the corn, but not the whole; and this part would be precisely equal to that of the landlord, the whole being overpaid in corn by the bounty. But the landlord, besides, would still be obliged to sell the corn at a certain price in the open market, in the same manner

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 18

as if he had sold it himself; or, if he wanted to keep the price of his own corn as near the mint price, as he could, he would have to pay a certain profit for keeping the corn so near it, in the same manner that he would for any other commodity. The profit which the farmer could afford, would be the same as that which the merchant, who had the same monopoly over the home market, could afford; but the real value of that profit, or of that quantity or value which it would exchange for in money or commodities of some kind, might be quite otherwise with regard to the different persons. The landlord might be obliged, in the same manner as he was before, either to give up the corn, in exchange, either altogether for money, or in payment for a part of the rent which he might otherwise pay to the farmer; or, perhaps, he might be able to sell the corn at a somewhat higher price than he otherwise might have been allowed to do, and thereby to make a profit by the difference. The landlord would be obliged, likewise, to pay a certain rent in money to the corn-dealer, in order to get the money to purchase the corn. The difference between the price which he could afford to pay for the corn and that which the corn-dealer would sell it at, would, no longer be equal to the value of the corn, or even to its nominal value; and, in consequence of this difference, he might not always be able to pay for that quantity or value in money. He would, therefore, be in want both of money and corn; of money, in the same way as he was in the former case; and, consequently of what is commonly called profit, in order to buy those two commodities. The corn-merchants, in the like case as the landlords are now the corn dealers, would probably find themselves the only people whom they could trust with their goods; because they could not always trust the farmers with theirs; and, as they would not be able either to sell their goods in their own shops at the proper price, or to buy them at the same, the price which the farmers would have been obliged to sell them at, they would probably suffer both the one and the other to go out of fashion very fast, and soon to be altogether forgotten.


 CHAP. IX.


OF THE PROFIT OR LOSS OF THE PROD

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 19

UCE, AS FAR UPSTREAM, OR UPSTREAM AS THE MARKET WILL TAKE IT, OR UPSTREAM AS THE CONSUMERS OF IT WILL CONSUME IT.
The money price of labour, as it rises, so it falls, and does not rise again till it sinks again. But the real price, the real command of labour, does not rise with that rise in the real value of the money price of labour, but, on account of that increase of wealth, it does not fall with it, either. It is only when, in the progress of improvement, this rise in money price of labour has produced a considerable rise in its real value, that the labour of those days can be more than replaced, and can afford a comfortable living to those who live in the present. The real command of labour, therefore, does not sink with that rise, or even rise with it, till after it has produced this comfortable and satisfying rise. It is not until after this rise, therefore, that the money price of the greater part of the necessaries of life begins, even in the present state of the greater part of manufactures, to sink gradually towards the price at which it would have sunk had the wealth and improvement, which had preceded that rise, been the same as they were at that period, or, what comes nearly to same thing, the money-price of the greater part, had been the same with that of the greater portion, or, what came almost to same, the price of the same portion of the necessary of life, in proportion to that which had gone to the rise of the price.

In the present times the real command of the greater part, or even that part only, which consists in the price or wages, of labour, seems, notwithstanding all the regulations which the mercants and retailers of the different countries, by means either either of statutes or of agreements, have made for regulating this command in some particular branches of their own trade, to sink gradually towards the real price, that is, the price at which it would have sunk if the riches, and improvement of those times had been in no respect different, or, what came very nearly, in the exact proportion, that they are in at present.

It seems, however, to have been otherwise in ancient Greece, and in the times immediately preceding the fall of the western empire, and in the republic of ancient Italy. The real price of labour

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 20

, however, is regulated, it is true, somewhat lower than its nominal price. But it varies much more in the one case than it does in the other. The wages and profits of labour vary much less with the variation in its real value. They are lower, accordingly in every period of the progress from a lower to a higher level of wealth. The real value of the annual labour of every society is, in reality and according to this system, always exactly the same. But the annual produce, or the quantity of commodities annually brought into existence, varies very much with every change in its real value; and the proportion between the real price and the neat rent or profit, between the real and the money-price of labour, is much less when wealth is gradually rising than when falling.

It must always be observed, too, in what proportion, and how soon, a rise or a fall of the value of the money-wage necessarily affects, either, firstly, the quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of the poor, or secondly the revenue, or the neat produce of the rich, the landlords and cultivators, of the country; and in what manner the latter may, either by increasing, or by diminishing, its real value, the one, as well as, or more than either the one, diminishes or adds to its neat produce.
The quantity of the necessary articles of the poorest sort of industry is, according as the real value of their wages and profits rises or falls, limited by three things, viz. their utility, their bulk, and their bulk and utility together.
The rise or decline in their real price, as soon as it takes place, necessarily increases the number and power of their competitors; and thereby tends, in a still greater proportion than the rise in their real wages, to increase their competition, to widen the circle of their rivals, and to lower, as much as possible their own profits, or the neat produce of their industry.

It necessarily diminifies, as soon as it takes place, their utility, by reducing the quantity and value of the materials which they may annually employ, and thereby reducing, in a still greater proportion, than the rise in their real wages does, the quantity of the materials which may be employed in every subsequent period of their existence.

The rise or decline of their bulk, as soon as it has happened, tends likewise to diminish their revenue or gross produce, as it

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 21

is called, or, in plain language, the price of the whole annual produce.

In consequence, therefore, of such revolutions, some manufactures have been rendered more bulky, some have become less so. Some commodities have become dearest to the consumer, while some others have become dearest to him for a longer period of years than they ever were before; while, at the same time, some have become cheaper and some cheaper, and some cheaper still. The cheapness of many things, however, seems to have arisen from the scarcity which the competition occasiones among the dealers in such commodities, who find themselves obliged to sell their commodities at a lower value, or at a greater loss, in order that other people may be obliged to sell theirs at a higher, or at a smaller profit, than they might otherwise be able to do. This scarcity, or rather this advantage of scarcity, has been much remarked in all ancient manufactures, particularly in those of Egypt, where every particular class or order of artificers seems to have enjoyed it for several generations together. In those of ancient Italy, too, we frequently read of great fortunes made in such manufactures, which, by means either (1) of a long exclusive trade in the neighbourhood of the town, or ( 2) of a monopoly granted by the sovereign to some particular family, afforded the proprietors a considerable advantage in the price and exchangeable value both of their corn and their cattle, which they were careful to accumulate, and of which they had the management, even after the fall of that family.


 CHAP. IV

OF COMMERCIOUS CONSUMPTION.  The Expense of Consumptuous Expense.  How it is affected by an Increase or a Diminution of Revenue.  Profit in Profitless Employment.

 The expense of a rich and thriving nation must evidently be proportioned to that of a poor and decaying one, and to the extent, not only of its revenue, but of its capital stock.

The expense of consumable commodities may be divided into three different portions; the expense which is necessary for bringing the commodity to market, the expense which is necessary for transporting it to the place of consumption, the third and last expense, which is the expense necessary for storing or keeping up the commodity after it has left its place of consumption, or after it has been consumed.

It has been shown in the second book, chap, iv.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 22

how much a small profit can be made by a stock of provisions. A great part, however, of it is lost in transportation, in the keeping, in the feeding, and in other necessary charges, which it would require to be laid out in order either to bring it from the farm, or to the market, but of a nature which cannot easily, without great waste and destruction of labour, be reduced to those few parts only which are fit for human use and application.

In order to give some notion of the expense which must be laid upon this last sort of rude produce, let us suppose a certain quantity of it, let it be a hundred weight, to consist in twenty-four quarters of wheat, or of one bushell full; let it be the ordinary price at which the quarter of wheat, when brought from the mill, is valued in all the different markets, in England, Ireland and Scotland. The price at which the bushel is valued, is everywhere in England about ten shillings and sixpence the quarter. If, by the improvement, the whole wheat crop, therefore, was worth twenty-four shilling, twenty shillings and four pences, there must, in all the markets, have been spent, either in preparing, purchasing or transporting it to the different places where it can be exchanged, a sum equal, perhaps, to all those different purchases, and all those separate journeys. In order to bring this quantity to the place of exchange, the merchant, who buys of the farmer twenty-eight shillings, must purchase of him, first, a certain quantity of the corn-meal, and, secondly, the tools and provisions requisite for raising it; the farmer himself must have purchased, in the price of the latter, the rent of his ground, and the wages and profit which are paid to those who tend and cultivate it. The price at which the whole is purchased and brought to market, is everywhere about thirty shillings the bushel, or about L.3 : 1 : 8d.; and if, in the different markets in which this commodity may be sold, this sum was spent in purchasing, purchasing or transporting the corn, it could not, perhaps be sold there cheaper than anywhere else. It could be bought, therefore, in every different market at thirty shillINGS the corn, or at about four times the price which it could have been had at, in consequence of the natural improvements of agriculture

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 23

.

The profits of the farmers and country labourers were, the greater part of them, regulated by their own discretion. They were, in this case, no more affected by what might happen to the market price than any other traders; but they were liable to the same occasional calamity, which, from the nature of things (and no doubt from the nature too of human affairs), they were much less able to prevent than other tradesmen. In the price of butcher's meat, a sudden rise of price sometimes happened, which could not well be prevented, and which, in the end, must always occasioned some loss to those who had the misfortune to deal directly in this article. In the price, however, of corn itself, a rise of five or ten pounds in the value of a bushel was, during a great part of the reign of Elizabeth, not uncommon. It happened in 1695, 1696, 1702, and in the reigns preceding 1701, when the bounties upon the exaltation of wheat, and upon the growth of its best qualities, had been very great.

When, in the actual state of tillage, the average rent and profit of land were such, as to afford a reasonable subsistence to a certain number, it might, perhaps in time, be proper, even in times of the most profound peace, that a certain portion of this surplus should be put aside for the maintenance of productive labourers; provided always, however (for though it may not always be proper), that this portion did not exceed in quantity what the demand of the country would admit.

But when, by some accident, a much greater portion of this surplus became necessary for maintaining idle and superfluous hands, it might, in the actual state, become proper, in the continuance 


 


 Of this second species of revenue, rent and profit seem to have been the original sources. The rent, indeed, is derived from the ground; but the profit, as it arises, not so much from the ground, as from what has been gained in employing labour.
The first species of revenue, the wages of productive labourer, seems, in every age and society of mankind, to have arisen altogether, or almost entirely from this original source. The second has arisen in some measure, and in some degree, from both the first and the third; from labour, in the original, and from stock, in

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 24

the improved state. It is, perhaps, in the progress of improvement only, that the stock of the country, or of any particular order or profession of men, naturally augments in the most rapid manner; while the labouring poor find it difficult to find employment, and the industrially rich are often obliged to employ servants and menial servants in order to get it. The demand for labour increases, the quantity produced increases in a still greater, and, as it were in a perpetual circle; till the whole produce is sufficient for supplying the demand.

The increase of the stock, in consequence of the improvement and cultivation of land, is, no doubt, a good thing; and, in its turn, contributes towards increasing the annual produce. But it is a bad thing, it seems to me, that the whole produce of this increased stock, which, in every particular country, consists altogether in the rude produce, is annually distributed among a smaller and a less numerous number of people than before. It tends to diminish very much both the real value of the rude produce, and consequently the real revenue of those who consume it; and to increase very much both the quantity of labour, and the quantity and value of the rude produce.

It tends likewise, in a still greater proportion, both to reduce the real value of the manufactured produce, and to increase the real price which is given for that manufacture. The value of the one, it is evident, must be greater in proportion to the quantity which it can purchase or command than the value which is given for that quantity, or the quantity only which can be employed in producing it. In the same proportion, therefore, the real price of manufactures must necessarily rise, or rather, in consequence of the improvement of the art of manufacturing, they will probably always have risen more or less.


Thirdly, and lastly;  The natural increase of the quantity and value of the annual rude produce, in proportion as stock improves and advances, necessarily tends to diminish the annual produce of all arts and manufacturers.

The quantity, both natural and acquired, which is annually employed in every particular branch of industry, is necessarily regulated by three different circumstances, of which the first two may be considered as the natural causes of its production, and of which the last two, the accidents which occasionally disturb or divert it, may, no more or less than these, be accounted for by the operations and institutions of human government.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 25

The first is the natural superiority of some over other trades, of some over all others, of the workmen over the employers of the workmen. This superiority arises, first, in the superior natural strength and agility of some individuals; and, secondly in their possessing an additional advantage in their learning, in the superior knowledge and experience with which they commonly deal in the different branches of business in hand, and with which their skill and dexterity are frequently much superior to those even of common tradesmen.

This superiority in the natural superiority, of the workmen, is the effect, no doubt, both of their education and of the superior advantages which their employers enjoy over them in every particular branch of business. But the cause of this superiority, of which this superior natural advantage is the effect only, must evidently have some cause which can alone occasion this superiority; otherwise the workman could never have learned it. The cause of the superior knowledge and experience of the workmen, on the other side, is the same, or very near the same, as that which gives the superiority in their natural strength, but is not, perhaps (I am not well informed), the same as that which gives that superiority in their learning. It must arise from some other cause which can give that superiority, independent of the superiority in the natural strength of the workmen, or of the superior knowledge and experience which their employers enjoy over themselves in all their particular branches.
The cause, however (I think I shall venture, at least, upon this supposition) of that superiority in the natural strength and abilities, must be the same as that which causes that superiority in their knowledge, experience, and superior natural strength. That cause must be the law of nature, the necessity imposed by the equality and completeness of rights upon the equal rights of every individual; of which, I shall consider hereafter the following example:

The law which oblige every individual, either to cultivate his own ground, to collect his produce in barrels or baskets upon his own farm or estate; to collect it in such quantities as he can employ, either himself or as a member or labourers in the farms and estates in which he dwell; is the cause of this superiority in the strength and abilities of all the individuals who exercise this natural privilege of cultivation. It is the cause which puts every individual in a condition to learn and to execute the operations of agriculture, to manage and to collect his own produce, in such manner as

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 26

he thinks proper. But it does not put him necessarily in that condition, unless the society which regulates its laws has likewise laid it upon his account, by giving him an establishment which enables him to carry it on with advantage and advantage. It puts him, however; and it does not oblige him. The exclusive privileges of corporations, by restraining, for the benefit either of themselves or of other people, the competition which would otherwise be so much 




 


 The monopoly of a particular branch of foreign trade, of the carrying trade, for example, by a law which allowed no other person to sell in that country goods of any other country, necessarily tends to raise the rate of profit higher than it otherwise might be, and thereby discourage more than half the capitals employed in this branch of trade from ever being employed in it. The high profits occasion a great demand, and consequently an extensive market, for the surplus produce, of other countries; and the exclusive privileges of the carriers, which restrain the competition of all others, tend to keep down this market, by rendering the goods which can be brought to market there cheaper, and thereby increasing, more or less the demand for them. The high rate of interest which attends upon this increase in demand, and the small quantity of capital employed upon the greater part of projects, necessarily tend to sink, more than any other cause, that of profits, and consequently that of the carrying trade, and thereby to discourage more or less, both that trade and all others.

The high profits occasion a great over-trades. They discourage more or Less the trade, not only for those commodities which pay a premium for their scarcity or dearliness, but for all commodities, in proportion as they are dearer than usual.

They occasion a great depression of the trade, not merely in the commodities, but even in the money price of the same commodities.

The exclusive privileges of corporations, therefore, have not only the effect, not only to discourage, but to prevent almost entirely, the accumulation of stock, both at home, and abroad, and consequently the improvement of the country; by raising wages above their proper level, and discouraging, in some measure at least, both the accumulation at work and the accumulation of stock.

They are the immediate cause, not of that accumulation, but rather of that improvement, which is, in reality, always the effect and consequence of accumulation; of what is produced, not

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 27

of the money, which pays for it.

It has been shown above, that the wages of the inferior classes of workmen are generally regulated by the demand for their labour. If there was a general rise in the price, they would rise with it, though they might not necessarily be paid with it. The demand, therefore, must be such, that, with a certain quantity of money, the labourer can buy or command the same quantity of the labour of the superior classes. But if the price rises beyond a certain sum, he cannot always buy with it this quantity; and the quantity which can be bought with it will be less, or more, or no better, or no worse, than before. He must, therefore be content with something smaller, or something greater, in proportion to his former wages; and, consequently, with less labour. The demand for the labour of the inferior classes of people, therefore (though not always the demand of the superior ones, as we shall hereafter shew), must always regulate that of the greater part, or, what comes nearly to the same thing, the whole, or, more properly, with the greater portion, the whole quantity, or the whole value of the annual produce. It regulates, not only the whole, or, properly, the whole value, of what can be brought either into being by the labour of the superior classes, or outof it, but the whole or the greater part of what can be either brought into existence, or outof it; and it regulates, in the one case, what is annually reproduced, in that which will continue to be reproduced after some period of years, according as some other portion, more or smaller than that portion which actually circumnavigates the earth, happens, in any respect either immediately or indirectly, to exceed, either the value of the whole or of the great body, of what is produced every year, or, more properly, the whole value which is commonly circulated and distributed among the inhabitants of every particular place.
The demand, too (I have endeavoured, at least, to show in the second chapter), is continually changing. It is constantly changing, not only with the increase and diminution of wealth, but with every change in the circumstances and situations of the society, with every alteration of its political form and government, and, lastly and principally, in the revolutions which take places in it, and in the revolutions which it makes in

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 28

all other societies, either in their political form or their governments. The wages, therefore of labour, are always regulated by some change in the circumstances, in the political, economical or religious form, and in the constitution of the society, to which it is subject. They never are regulated altogether by those funds; and they never can be so regulated but in a much slower pace than the nature of the work renders possible.

The wages of labour are, in this respect, not very unlike the profits and wages of stock. They arise partly from the interest or profit of money; but partly from the rent, both of land and labour; partly from the wages, or the price of the necessaries and comforts of life; and partly from the profit of stock, or what remains, after deducting the expense of employing the workmen, the wages of management and maintenance, the profit upon the stock, and what remains, after paying those different expenses; the whole of which, however (it is evident enough) must always bear a certain proportion to what was paid for the work.
The difference between the profits of stock in the one case, and the wages, and the price of the necessary and conveniences, which are paid by labour, in the other is very great. The profit of the farmer upon the whole produce, including not only his own, but that likewise of the farmer's neighbour, and of all his neighbours, is the same as the whole wages of the labourers. The rent of the landlord, and the profits upon the whole capital of stock employed, must be equal, or very nearly equal. But the whole price of labour must be paid by something else, besides the wages of the labourer; the whole price of provisions, and of the whole stock which the labourers employ about their work; something, too, that bears some sensible proportion to the profit of the stock which employs them about that work, as well as to the wages and maintenance which they themselves enjoy upon it. It is otherwise, however, with the price of provisions. Though it bears a considerable proportion to the profits, yet the price of provisions does not always bear a very great proportion to the wages, or to the neat price or value, which they themselves receive upon the employment of the whole quantity of labour necessary to bring them to market, and which, consequently, bears a very great proportion, not only to the whole profit, but to all those different parts of it

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 29

too, to their whole gross produce. The whole value of the gross produces of labour, the price of provisions included in it, must bear some very small part, however, of that proportion to its value as a component part of the price or exchangeable quantity of the goods which are brought from the fields to the shops, and from the shop-fronts to the table; otherwise the labourer would not be so well paid. It must bear some much greater, though still a very small, proportion, however, than the wages, and the neat price, or value which they pay to him. The wages of labour, therefore, must always bear some much smaller proportion than their value as a component part, and the whole price of labour, including the whole value of the neat price or exchangeable quantity which it pays, will always bear some much greater proportion than its value as a component part. It is this great proportion which regulates the ordinary or ordinary price of labour, or, in plain language speaking the real recompence or value of its labour, the money price of its labour. The money price of labour is, in reality, the real price of the rude produce of land, or the real recompence of the land and labour which must be employed in bringing it to market; and is, consequently, regulated by this very great proportion only.
The real price, however, of every particular commodity must always bear a certain proportion, and must bear it in the same proportion that the quantity of it employed is regulated, not only by the demand and supply, by the annual produce of the land, of which it is a component, and by all those other things which are necessarily connected with that produce, such, perhaps as are likewise connected with that demand, such as its utility and agreeable qualities, and such as may render the use or consumption of the commodities, even when no more of them is to be had than what is sufficient to maintain, employ, and clothe, their present owners; but by the proportion which that quantity of labour requires to be employed, not only in bringing the commodity from the ground to the market place, but in preparing and bringing back its produce, or in bringing back its utility or agreeable qualities, or, what comes to the same purpose with the one and the same thing, in making and bringing back the second, as well.

In China and the East Indies, the wages of labour, as in many countries of Asia and the East

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 30

Indies, are very low; but that in Great Britain is much higher. In Great Britain, therefore the price of labour, though it is very low everywhere in proportion to its real recompence (that is, the money price of the labour), yet it is much above its real recompence. It must, however, in those two different countries, be somewhat lower than in England, in order that the demand for it, which is so very small in Great England (and there is no country in the world in which the demand for labour is so great, or in which, in proportion to its money price, it can be so much reduced) should have some room to increase, or rather to flourish.
The wages of the greater part of manufactures, it has already appeared in the second book of this Inquiry, have generally fallen in consequence of the improvement of machinery; and the same cause has produced the rise of their price. But in the case, indeed, of some manufactures the fall has not been so sudden and total, as in that of others, in which it has.

It must be remembered that, before the discovery of the mines, all those improvements of machinery which reduce the labour of a workman, or render his labour more convenient and cheaper, necessarily raise the wages of that particular species of labour which it is employed to perform, or at least make up for some part of the deficiency of them. The same causes which, in other circumstances, increase, in this case, the profits of the workmen, increase likewise the wages of their work. The rise of wages is the effect, not of any one thing, but of all the circumstances that happen in a workhouse; of what happens to be the most proper place to put it, or to give it proper encouragement; of the most proper time to set it in motion, of the greatest number of hands to be employed in performing it. It is not because a certain number of hands are more profitable to the employer, or that he gets a greater profit by employing them, than a greater or smaller number; it arises from the nature of the work itself, from the nature of the employment. The rise of profit is the necessary effect of the rise in the wages of labour; and both together are necessary causes of the rise of the wages of labour. It must be observed, too, in what proportion the rise in wages bears to the rise in the profits of stock, and in the rise in both

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 31

of those, to that which takes place in the wages of labour; for if it does not bear a very considerable degree to one of those, but a very small to the other, the demand of the workman will soon raise the price of labour to a level with the highest price of corn, and thereby reduce his wages to a much lower one than the lowest price which can justifiably have been paid for that kind of labour. The demand of the labourer will, therefore, in this manner, be more or less affected by all the variations in the price either, of the rude produce, or of the manufactured. It is the demand of those two different orders, therefore, which principally regulates that of the greater part, and not that of any particular order within them; and the variations of the wages of labour are, in this respect, as necessarily regulated, as are the variations in the price either of rude or of manufactured produce.

But though all those different rates of wages, it has already appeared, are regulated by the same principle of competition and necessitation, the one between the different employers and workmen of industry; yet the competition of those two orders of employers and labourers is in many different places, not the only or principal one, but ancienty concurrent.


First, the competition of the great mercantiles and manufacturers, which supply all the markets with all their necessary articles, is in every particular market not alone the sole or chief competitor, but anciently concurrent. The demand of those merchants is not only in some particular places necessarily regulated, according as they are able and disposed, by the cheapness or scarcity of the materials and finished goods which they deal in; but, from the nature of the business itself (which, in its present state of improvement, is so very different from the rude and manufacturing stages), it must be regulated, not only by the general demand of the country where it is carried 




First, the competition of those two different orders of employers and labourers is, in every specific place, not the sole or chief competitor; and, secondly, it is the interest, or the prudence of those different orders of employers, which regulates, in each of those particular places, that of all their workpeople.
The interest or prudence of those great mercantiles and manufactures is not only in some particular places, necessarily concurrent with the interest or good temper, both of their

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 32

own particular country and that of the whole world; but it is, in general and in the greater part of all cases, necessarily connected with it, and necessarily directed towards that object.

The same interest which would naturally lead a manufacturer, who lived at Paris or Amsterdam to employ his industry in supplying foreign countries with the materials and finished goods for the manufactures of Great Britain, should lead him likewise to supply them with the materials and finished goods for the manufactures of those other countries. It is not because the materials and the finished workmen of one country are necessarily useful to those of all other nations; it is because, in the particular circumstances of each particular country, they afford such a demand for those materials and finished work, as occasions a demand in all other countries. If they did not, the materials and the workmen could not be brought througgh the home market. The same cause which would naturally lead a brewer to supply foreign countries, if he was himself a brewer in Great Britain; or, again, a butcher to furnish them with butcher's goods, would likewise lead a manufacturer to furnish foreign countries with such of his own as he thought proper, or to supply those countries with the surplus parts either of his own or of the goods of some foreign country.

If we except, perhaps, the wine trade of France and Spain, which is carried on by private adventurers, and which has no permanent capital of the same kind with that of Great Britain, there is no other foreign trade, in the greater or smaller part of the commercial world, in which the interests of private people, acting either independently or in concert with one another (and in many cases both), have been, and are still more frequently acting in conjunction, than in the trade to the East Indies. The interest or good temper of the merchants and manufacturers of all these different nations, therefore (except the Dutch and French, whom I shall have occasion to mention hereafter) necessarily tends, more or less, to promote the interest or prosperity, both, of all their neighbours to the east of them, of all those who trade to that east, of those to whom they carry on their foreign trade; or of those who have any share, either of the materials of their work, of the stock upon their credit or in trust for them; or, in short, of every body, who lives, moves, or has his habitation in a foreign, or even of a neighbouring, country, and in

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 33

a country not very distant, but of which he has no knowledge or acquaintance, either in this world, or the one above, or in the other below, or even at this moment. It is by means of liberal, or rather of generous wages, that the merchants and manufacturers, who are thus promoted by liberal or generous governments, endeavour not only not only to supply their neighbours with a greater quantity of their own manufactured produce than they themselves can possibly consume; but, on the contrary, to raise their prices as high, as they can, in order to sell as cheap, and to encourage their neighbours to consume as much as they themselves can possibly consume. They endeavour, too, to make as great a profit as possible upon their stock; and they are careful not to let any part go to waste, but, by saving, they endeavour likewise not to lose any of the value of what they have saved, by the accidental destruction, either, either, of their shop-keeper's trade or of his employment; and they endeavour, in the same manner, to keep their workhouse as neat and clean, as convenient, and as neat as possible. The wages, it is to be hoped, are never so high as those of a common labourer in a manufacturing town, who works under a system of management, in the same way that the profits of merchants are in a commercial town; but the whole price of their work being always divided between them and their workmen, and being generally no higher than the wages, it cannot well be much above them. The whole price, therefore, of every sort or kind of work which the workmen carry on to any considerable distance from the place of manufacture, must, from its high wages, naturally, too, be somewhat above their ordinary price; or the whole quantity of it, which they are obliged to sell for a certain price, will never afford them a very comfortable subsistence, and will be, upon that account, rather a source of misery, and, upon that account, of a source of expense and expense, to those who are not employed in the work itself, but who are merely the carriers, carriers and carriers of the goods, which those who work near it purchase with the wages which those workman receive.

In the liberal or charitable government of Holland,[53], the interest and prosperity of all those who reside in distant countries, and of those who carry their industry to distant countries, are promoted in the same manner

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 34

as those of the inhabitants. In a free and unmortgaged common stock, every individual is bound equally, or rather, more nearly than any of them, to promote the prosperity and interest of the society in whose favour he takes refuge. He is obliged to do this in two different ways. He must, upon pain either of forfeiting his right to take any further refuge, or of being incapable altogether of doing so; or of paying a fine, called a peage or subsidy. If, in the course of the term, the peage or subsidy does not, upon that particular day, exceed what would be due to him for a certain number of months together, he may resume his right to take refuge in any of the provinces of the empire, without forfeiting it; provided that, before he resumes it he pays the penalty, which is commonly a sum sufficient for compensating this extraordinary enhancement of the peages or subsidies of the whole term. If he has not paid such fine within six months, or, if he has paid it, before he can resume the exercise of his rights of refuge, and without forfeishing the benefit of the subsidy, he forfeits the right to do so for ever, and must, therefore, be removed out of the country; and if he does resume it after this penalty, the penalty is tripled, or doubled. The encouragement given in this manner, to the industry of those in other countries who carry on their business among their fellow-subjects in their country of residence, is exactly the same with the encouragement given to that industry of the inhabitants of a distant country, carried upon its own account, in the same manner, by a set of people, who have no interest to promote the interest either of the society, or of those whom they govern, but whose only object is the prosperity and extension of their own private fortunes.

It may be proper, in the present case, to remark, that, though, by this liberal and charitable system of government, Holland has not, perhaps, acquired, perhaps never will acquire, the wealth, or even the greatness, of any of its neighbours; yet it certainly has acquired, or is very near to acquiring the wealth, or even the greatness, both of Europe and the greater parts of Asia; of countries which have, or which have had the fortune to possess, the liberal and generous spirit which the constitution of Holland seems to encourage and support so well. It certainly has not only

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 35

increased the quantity of industry, but, by opening a new trade to it, has enabled the country to increase still more that of the produce which that industry produces. It has, besides this, given occasion, by opening the way for a greater number of foreign manufactures into Great Britain, to a still further increase of the produce of that industry. The competition between foreign and home manufactures is always in favour of the latter, and against the former. It favours those manufactures of the country which have the nearest market, and which are, therefore most likely to sell in this distant one. The greater part of the foreign manufactures of Great Britain, accordingly, come either directly or through some foreign trading company from some country which has some considerable share of this nearer market. The competition between the manufactures and the foreign goods of Great Britain has accordingly increased much more in proportion to the extent of the home trade, and the foreign goods of Great Great Britain in a much smaller degree than in the case of the same manufactures carried on from foreign capitals. The home trade, therefore, has been much more important in the extension and prosperity both of British industry, as we shall see in a little time, and of the annual produce of British industry, as well as of the produce annually brought from Great Great Britain, than it has in the reduction of those two quantities, the produce and the market price, both which are in proportion, perhaps, to the extent of that trade. The trade of the colonies has contributed to no other effect but the extension, both of the industry of Great Britain, as well of that of the colonies as that both of the two countries; and the extension, both in this and in the foregoing manner, seems not to be altogether independent, or even to be altogether uniform.




 CHAP II

OF THE IMPORTANCE, AT LEAST, OF A MARKETPLACEMENT FROM THE FOREIGN CAPITAL OF THOSE WHO CAN BUILD GOODS OF THEIR COUNTRY.

 Though it may not always be in their interest to export the complete manufactures, or even the materials, and the wages, of which those foreign goods consist, they will generally endeavour to export as many parts only of them as can fit themselves for their own consumption, and for which they are willing to exchange, at least in the one or two places of sale to which they can send them, a certain quantity, or, what comes to the like thing, a certain value

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 36

of, labour. They generally import from other countries only the materials, the wages and profit of the labour which is employed in preparing those foreign goods; but they will seldom import more than a part of those materials, or even of those wages, and will always endeavour to export as much of those goods as they are capable either of manufacturing, or even of selling in their own country. If the profits of their own industry are not sufficient to maintain the same number of workmen in the same employment during a year, they will endeavour to diminish those profits as much as possible, in the same manner as merchants do by underselling one another, by selling cheaper, and by keeping their prices lower than they otherwise might be.
The profits of all such artifices as prepare foreign manufactures, and of all foreign merchants, therefore, though not raised by the rise of stock, yet sink in proportion as stock increases, and rise in proportion as stock declines. The increase of stock, it has already appeared, raises wages in every different branch both of agriculture, manufactures and commerce, but it lowers profits in all of them, except in that branch of commerce which deals chiefly in home made commodities.

It is not by raising, indeed (for that is impossible), the wages, or by lowering the profit of labour, that any rise of stock can increase the real revenue and wealth, the real revenue and wealth, either of the society, or of those who exercise some of its duties. The rise of the stock, however, that is raised by the employment of a greater stock, may, in this manner, raise wages and profit in all of them; and may, therefore, increase both the real revenue and wealth, and the real revenue and wealth, of every different class of people in the society, or of those who exercise any one of its various and variously important duties. The rise of stock in any society necessarily raises the wages of labour, and sinks the profit of stock. The rise of stock, too, in every country, naturally introduces a new order of things among its citizens, a new mode of life and manners, which cannot fail to increase, both the quantity of labour and the value of that labour, though not so much, perhaps, as the increase in stock may increase its competition and competition against other people.

It is not the increase of stock, indeed, in the rude state, that raises wages, but that of rude produce, in proportion to the increase

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 37

of stock. The increase in the quantity of the rude produce is, upon most occasions, sufficient, not only to replace all the stock employed in bringing that produce from its original source, and to maintain all the labourers, farmers and artificers, who are necessary for collecting and preparing that original supply, but, in consequence of a certain improvement of cultivation and improved methods of farming, it is also sufficient to pay the whole wages and profit which must be paid in order to bring it thither, and, consequently, to maintain and employ the whole number which was originally employed in collecting, bringing, and preparing the produce, together with the whole profits and wages which were either taken or retained by those two sets of people, together with the profits and losses which were either saved, or incurred, in bringing them from their natural source.

But in every great society, in the progress of improvement, this original source must become gradually less fertile, and, therefore less abundant, the land must gradually become more and better cultivated, and more and better manufactured, the labour must become more and better directed, and consequently, that original supply of rude, or subsistence food, gradually diminish, till, in the end, it becomes completely exhausted. In this state of things the wages of labour, though higher than they were in any rude or barbarous state of society (which was, perhaps in many cases, much worse), are, in reality, lower than they would have been in a still worse.

But though the quantity of stock employed in bringing any produce to the table be greater, and consequently the real recompence or price which is paid to labour for bringing that product, be lower in the rude state than in the improved state; yet in both these states, it is the same quantity only, that is brought to the table; and in both, the whole quantity brought, not only replaces, with a profit to the owner of it, the whole capital which he employs in bringing it, together, or with his own profit; but pays, with a profit to the proprietor of the land upon whose behalf it was brought thithin; together with the ordinary profits of agriculture, and with all the ordinary and unavoidable losses which the operation of human laws and industry may occasion in any country. In both, too much, or in neither too much, stock is employed, or in any one operation too great; but, in the progress of improvement, stock becomes gradually less, or

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 38

, what comes to be of more importance, gradually becomes gradually greater, and consequently less expensive, till it at last ceases altogether.

In a country which is advancing to a great height in the progress towards improvement and prosperity, stock, in proportion to what can be employed with advantage in the improvement of the land, naturally decays gradually; and in proportion as this degradation is not compensated by an increase in its quantity, the operations of stock become more and more expensive. In the course, however, to which this degradation in stock is brought about, it may happen even, sometimes even during the course of the most extensive commercial intercourse, and sometimes only after it has gone on some time, that the operations of a small stock become, and even for a time actually are very nearly upon an equal footing, with those of a great one; and though, before the decay of the latter has gone on too far, stock may frequently, even during the course of such commerce and intercourse, purchase a smaller quantity, yet, in the course of it being gradually reduced in its power of purchasing, it becomes gradually cheaper, till at last, after the decay has gone so far, stock may frequently, and even during the course of it having gone on a long time, even purchase a much greater quantity. The diminution in stock, however, which naturally follows this decay, is not always equal in extent to what may properly be called a new colonization, but may be quite otherwise. It sometimes happens, even in the most thriving countries, and even in countries that are advancing to the highest degree in the improvement of their arts and manufactures, that, in the course of some centuries, a very great stock is continually accumulated, and that, in the mean time (the course being so very short) it is continually diminishing in power of purchasing; but though, for a very long time, this diminuency is not compensated, it soon becomes completely compensated by an increasing quantity, by the continual accumulation, either of gold or silver money; the quantity, however, which the circulation of the country is supposed always sufficient for purchasing being always much, much greater, and sometimes exceeding greatly, both in quantity, indeed (a circumstance which may be considered as an accidental circumstance), and in quality, than that which the greater part of European nations have hitherto had occasion for.

The natural consequence of this degradation in stock in the advanced state of any particular country, may frequently be, not only the reduction

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 39

in the rate of interest which that country naturally enjoys in its capital, but, more commonly, the diminuency in its annual produce, and consequently the scarcity of that annual produce, which is so necessary for the maintenance, enjoyment and prosperity of the people. The reduction in stock must always, however, be gradual and slow, and must always take place, not only with the progress of improvement, but with that of decay, as well as with the advance of new improvements, the most important of all. It must, too, in the long-run, necessarily diminish very much both the stock of those who are advancing to the further improvement, as well as the annual production of that country. The stock which advances to the further improvement, must always consist in a much greater number of smaller and more numerous stocks than that which declines to the decay. The stock which advances is necessarily much greater than that which decays. In the progress from the first to the second degree, the stocks of all who are advancing are generally greater than the stocks of those whom it is intended should follow after them; in the progress to that degree, those who are succeeding to those who preceded them are likewise usually much superior in stock to the former, though they generally are less in numbers. But though in every successive degree of improvement the stock of the advanced state must necessarily be much greater than that of the decay, yet in the progress from the second to the third, fourth, and fifth degrees, it must generally be somewhat smaller than that of the former.
3. In the Progress from the first to all subsequent Progrms, the Interest of Money diminishes with every Improvement in the Circulation of Money. The circulation of every country, as it circulates the annual produce, increases with every improvement in its industry and wealth. The increase of the stock of the country raises the rate of its profit; because stock, by augmentating its quantity, increases the value of what it can purchase or exchange. But as, in every country which is improving, there are always many rich and industrious people who are unwilling that their stock increase beyond what they themselves consume, so, in every country which declines in its prosperity, many poor and unprosperous people are eager to accumulate stock. The increase of the circulating money in such countries necessarily tends, therefore 


 4. The Increase in the Quantity of Silver, or of whatever else is circulated in a country with the money which is issued

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 40

from it, necessarily augmentation of the quantity of labour, or the price of labour, which must always accompany that increase, and which cannot be brought about without an additional quantity of silver being continually added. The increase in its price necessarily occasions a rise in the wages of labour; and this rise in wages is always the effect, not of the rise in the real value of that metal, which is the immediate effect, but rather, of the increase of the quantity of the necessary materials, of which that metal makes use; the wages of those labour-necessary commodities. It was thus that, in England, during a great part both of Mr. Locke's time (when Mr Hume wrote), and of that long period before the present, the rise in the value of the coin was accompanied with a considerable fall of wages; though, at the time, this rise of wages could have no sensible effect upon the real value either of silver, of what had been issued by the government since 1722, of the money of those days; for the money of the present times has not then risen to its present high value. The rise of wages was, upon the whole, owing altogether to a fall in its real value; to a fall in the quantity of labour which could then be annually purchased with the money which was then in use. The fall of its real value occasioned a further fall of wages. The fall in the quantity, therefore, of both these things necessarily occasiones a third, a fourth and, perhaps a fifth fall in their actual values; which together make up a total fall of the wages of labour in the country. The whole quantity of silver, therefore (though the real value of that metal has not increased since 1722), yet the real wages of labour, the whole real revenue which can arise out either from that annual revenue of the people, or, by the annual consumption of that annual revenue; the rent of the land, for instance, the profits of stock, and the interest of money; the whole real wealth which affords a revenue or profit, either to the individuals who possess that annual revenue or profit or, if you prefer, to the public revenue, have, in all these cases, been continually diminishing, or have been continually on the decline, since the discovery of the abundant mines of America. In order, however (I have endeavours constantly to shew you) to prevent the diminution of the value of silver from any accidental cause (the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 41

natural course of things, perhaps, which no human wisdom can prevent), the policy of the state must endeavour always to raise the wages and to lower the profit, so that the value, both of the precious metal and of its component materials (wheat, cattle, &amp.;c.), may continue to increase.

The policy of all the great commercial nations has hitherto taken this course. The wages of labour, in every country, are everywhere regulated by the market price of labour, the real command of the necessaries of life; the price at which labour can be purchased with the greatest possible quantity either either of money, or of goods of some kind of equal value. In England the ordinary price of labour, according as the seasons are temperately or unseasonably mild, is said sometimes not to exceed tenpenny, sometimes only eightpenny an hour; and it is in this manner determined by a certain proportion between the quantity of labour which it is thought necessary, or convenient for the labourer, to acquire, and the quantity of money, or goods, that he can either afford to purchase or to maintain, during a certain time, or in a certain place, according to the degree of their scarcity or abundance, in consequence either either either of their being produced or consumed by the industrious or un-industrious classes of the people.

The market price, therefore (I shall attempt to show hereafter), regulates not so much the real, or the real recompence or recompence of labour, in every particular place, as that which is due to its natural tendency, the increase or diminuation, in all places and all times, of the value of its materials, the quantity of money which can either be employed in purchasing them, or the goods with the same value.

It has been shown in what proportion the profits of stock are likely, in any given employment, to rise or fall with the market rate of interest; but it is unnecessary to say further what this proportion is, or how far it may affect the rate at which capital can be employed in every branch of business.

In all great towns, and in those in the remotest provinces of Europe, the market price of all the different parts of the rude produce of land seems everywhere to have been regulated by the same principles, or by the market rate of profit in all the different branches of farming.

When a certain portion of this price, or of the produce which

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 42

it will bring to market, has been advanced, the farmer, in the same manner as he advances the rent of the land upon which the cattle are kept, advances the price which must be paid for the maintenance of those animals, in order to enable him to continue their existence. The profit, therefore, which is drawn from their consumption, is in the same proportion to that of their maintenance as the price which had before gone to the landlord.

The price of labour and subsistence does not rise with that of cattle, but, in proportion as the former become more expensive, the latter becomes cheaper. A tax upon the produce of land would raise the price of cattle; a tax of this sort, therefore, would necessarily raise the price of labour and subsistence too; and though both would fall somewhat short of the rent which the farmer would have got for them had they never come into competition with the rent of land, yet the whole price, the whole quantity of subsistence which the farmer could have afforded to his labour, if there had never existed any other commodity, would have been less than it actually is. It would, indeed, be somewhat less than what the demand would afterwards occasion.


 CHAP. IX.


 OF THE PROFIT AND COMMERCE WHEAT COUNTS.


 Wheat, indeed, does not pay its proper rent, in proportion as its price rises in proportion to its quality, but in consequence of some other circumstance; of the great expense, for example, of raising, preparing, storing, and bringing it from the ground to market, in all the various parts of Europe. But this circumstance, besides being of very recent invention, has no other foundation but in the common prejudices and opinions of the common people; prejudices and ideas formed during the greater part of the present century. It is, therefore, not worth while, even for speculative purposes, even in this chapter, to examine very deeply the causes which may have given rise either to that expense, or to that quality, or both together; for the truth, I believe, can be more easily found out, by examining the causes which give birth both to those two different prices.
3d Part of Wheat at the average of three years, and at four-and-twenty months. The price of the best wheat at present is generally between ten shillINGS and eleven shillings a bushel, or from six to seven pounds the quarter. At an expense, therefore

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 43

(for which there was always a ready money supply) which was equal to the value of this stock reserved for immediate consumption, it would not have been necessary that the society should have spent any of this stock to maintain or to procure subsistence for the labourer, the husbandman, or the artificers, in order to make him work, but that it should, at most times, have paid for his wages.

In the same manner, when stock is continually going from the society in order either to be employed in producing more goods, in order that it may be re-carried away again, and thus reproduced in the shape either of capital or of revenue, it is only by means, and in consequence, of a perpetual accumulation of new capital and revenue that it is possible to maintain or to procure subsistence for the labourer, the husbandmen or artificers, who reproduce it.

When, on the contrary, the society is constantly losing or running out, either the stock which had before produced these goods, and which was afterwards employed in reproduc ing those goods, or the capital which was before maintained or procured subsistence for these goods, stock is continually going from the society. The quantity of consumable goods annually produced, is necessarily lessened; and the value annually saved out, in the shape either of capital, or of revenues (for both these are annually reproduced in the same shape as stock, or as money), is necessarily greater than before, or, what comes to nearly about same thing, the quantity annually produced being necessarily diminished. The value, too, which, in consequence of the constant and uninterrupted loss of stock, had been annually saved out, is necessarily augmented; and the number of people annually maintained, in order to reproduce that value, is necessarily reduced, in consequence of the constant, uninterrupted loss of stock.

It is the same case, in every particular period, with regard to every different employment or employment service.

When, by some accidental accident, stock becomes idle, or is dissipated through the greater portion of the society, it is the effect rather of a general, than of an occasional declension in the annual production, than of a temporary and occasional reduction in the demand.

When, in order either to save, or to increase, the annual produce of stock, some part of it is employed, not only in maintaining, or purchasing of the labourers and other labouring people, but in preparing and

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 44

procuring the instruments and provisions necessary both for their subsistence and their employment, the whole capital employed in this manner necessarily belongs, not only to those labourers and other labouring people who enjoy it, but likewise, as their immediate employer, to their employer, and to the owner of that stock. The profits of this stock must likewise belong to those who enjoy it, or at least be sufficient, not only to pay, together, all the rent which they are supposed to pay, together with their reasonable profit upon it, but also to defray the expense of their management.
The whole capital of the farmer or landlord must always belong to them; because, though the instruments of husbanding may belong to different farmers and landlords, the stock employed in them belongs to the same, or very nearly to the same. The farmer or landowner, however, who employs his capital in purchasing the instruments and provisions for the employment of a particular set of labouring people only, is not necessarily a monopolist. Though he may be the only man that ever possesses either instrument of agriculture or provisions; though, therefore, his profits must necessarily be much smaller than those of any private farmer, who has a stock reserved in his granaries or storehouses for immediate consumption. His profits, on the contrary, may frequently, and perhaps always, exceed those of any other farmer; for the stock of all such farmers can never be so great as the labouring people whom it is employed upon; nor can the instrument of agriculture or provisions, for the same reason, for the sake of the same reason that the stock of all such farmers is never so large as the labour which executes their instructions. It is because the stock of the farmer or landlord can be increased only by the annual increase of the produce, or the purchase or hiring of more instruments of agriculture, and provisions, that the profits of such a stock can always exceed the ordinary level of profit in trade or manufactures. It can be increased only by means of a continual and uninterrupted increase of the labour and produce of the country. It is because they cannot be increased otherwise than by means of this constant and uninterrupted growth in its produce, that such a capital can always, and without any obstruction or contrivance of this kind be employed, and continue to be employed, for any long period of time, in the improvement and cultivation of land; or, as the proverb has it, in the perpetual tending and tending of cattle, in order that they may

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 45

have room to increase and multiply, and thereby to provide a continually increasing subsistence for their keeper. The capital of an undertakers of any sort, whether it be that employed in the improvement and cultivation, or in the purchase, carriage, or sale of commodities, must, from its nature, increase in the same manner as this perpetual increase in its produce, and consequently in a like proportion. It can increase only in a greater quantity. The quantity which the capital can afford, is greater or smaller; the quantity of labour which it maintains, in proportion to its own quantity. The capital which maintains a greater quantity of labour, generally employs a larger capital; the capital which maintains a smaller, employs a smaller. The greater part, however of the capitals of every kind which are either annually acquired or annually purchased, will, in all cases, be sufficient to maintain the equal quantity either of productive, as in the case of the land and labour of the society; or of destructive, as in that of all the instruments and means of trade. The capital of a merchant, or of any other person who deals in goods, will, in the same way, generally employ a larger or smaller quantity of labour than that of an undertaker of land. His stock will increase, not in a like proportion, though his capital may, and in most cases it does, increase in a very similar proportion. His stock is, upon that account necessarily destined for some more extensive, not to say a more permanent, purpose, and is necessarily employed for that purpose. The same capital, however, may be employed, and will be so employed, in the two different ways above described; as, for example, as a merchant, or as an undertakers of land.
3d. In order that a capital, even though continually increasing in its own nature and extent (as the stock which maintains and employs all the productive labourers in the country must be continually increasing, in order to supply their increasing wants and their continually increasing employment), and though continually augmenting its own quantity, may yet be capable of being augmented still further, it is requisite that the annual increase of this quantity should not be confined altogether to that which arises from the continual increase in the produce, but should be augmented, too, in a still greater quantity. This additional quantity of produce, therefore, or, what is nearly the same thing, the rent and profit which this produce brings into competition, is what must constantly increase in a

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 46

free trade.

It is otherwise, when the trade is subject either to the exclusive privilege of a particular merchant, who can charge whatever price he pleases upon it, or to the duty of the custom-house officer, who assesses a certain duty upon every different sort and species of goods, according to the different rates at present in force in the respective countries. In the one case the quantity of the goods which can be brought to market is limited; and in the other the whole world may be considered, and every man may be taxed as if every man was taxed in proportion to what was commonly paid by him for his share in the duties of customs, excise, and the like. The monopoly, besides, is a most oppressive tax upon every part, both 


  It subjects every man, whether a citizen, or subject, either to an arbitrary examination, or to an arbitrary removal from a particular place or district.

The monopoly is, in reality, a very great tax upon the people, and a most oppressive tax upon all parts, both of the produce and labour of the country, to the greatest possible amount, though perhaps to a still greater. The people must be forced to pay for what the merchants and manufacturers of the particular country, who enjoy that monopoly, think proper to give them. The people are, no doubt, generally more than sufficiently supplied with every sort of goods of the most common kind, which are the objects of their commerce, but they are not always supplied in proportion to what they themselves are willing to pay for, or to the real scarcity or cheapness of the goods in competition. The greater part of the manufactures which are carried to market in England, for example, come to it almost entirely from foreign countries, where there is little, if any, competition. But if we except the linen manufacture, the greater part, probably all of the other manufactures of England, except perhaps the coarser ones of linen, come to market in the same manner. If the linen manufacturer is obliged to give up a considerable part, or all of his trade to foreigners, he cannot sell his goods at the rate of a monopolist, but must content himself, like all other dealers, with a much smaller quantity of their sale than he otherwise might do; or, what comes to nearly the same thing in all circumstances of things, must give up some of the most important branches of his trade to foreigners, who will furnish him with all those goods

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 47

at a much lower rate than he could otherwise expect. If, on the other hand, he can keep up a greater share, and consequently sell his goods at the rate of a monopoly, the foreign manufacturers will not be able to buy them at so great an advantage. Their competition with one another will, in most cases, be much greater, and, in the greater part, it must necessarily be much more violent, and consequently much more ruinous to the country, than it ever could have been in a case in which there was a perfect freedom of trade, and the competition between the foreign manufacturers was confined to the lowest common rate.

In the different states into which Europe was divided at the close of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries (the countries which at that time constituted what are now the provinces of Germany and Switzerland), there were two great empires; that of the Habsburgs over Hungary, and the Romanov dynasty of Russia over Poland. The commerce between these two powerful states necessarily gave occasion to two great manufactures; the silk manufacture of Hungary over against that which the Venetic family had established at Venice; and that manufacture of Venice, against that which that family had established at Genoa. The trade of Hungary, therefore, gave occasion both to that great empire of Europe, and to the manufacture of that empire; while the trade of Venice gave neither occasion to any such empire, nor to that manufacture, though the latter flourished very greatly at Venice.

In the progress of wealth and improvement in any particular society, the demand for the commodities which it produces naturally increases in a great proportion, and the quantity brought to market diminishes in a still higher ratio, till it falls to a level with the supply; or till the quantity brought is no greater in the former state than in the other; and the quantity imported is no greater than in the latter, either in its whole bulk or as it is broken down into its component portions. In a state of society, therefore, in which the whole of every sort of produce was brought to the market, the price of every sort of produce would be equal to the quantity brought; or to the money price, that price being sufficient both for bringing that commodity to market and for purchasing or employing the workmen who brought it. In a state of war, the price of war would necessarily be somewhat higher than it otherwise might be, in order to pay the expenses of war; the money price of war being

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 48

in proportion to the money value of what is purchased with it. The money price of peace would, in the same manner, be somewhat higher in a state of peace than in a state which had been involved in war.
The money price, therefore, both of new and of old trades, is in proportion to the value of the commodities which are sold in them, and to the extent of the markets to which they can either supply or be supplied. It varies with the increase or diminution of the demand for such commodities. It is higher in new, and lower when there is an increasing, or when there is an increasing demand. In the one case it rises in proportion to the increase of the quantity of the commodity, in the other to that increase in its quality; in one way, therefore it is the price of an increasing quantity, in another it rises in the same proportion to that of an equally good but smaller quantity; and, as the demand for every commodity increases, its money price naturally tends to rise in the same proportion, or, what comes to the like thing in the same proportion, to its real price. The demand for the rude produce, for example of America and of the East Indies, must necessarily be increasing. The money price of such rude produce will naturally increase in proportion to that of the greater portion, not of what is annually produced, but in that of the annual produce of the lands, of which the produce is annually consumed by these rude nations. The demand for their manufactures and foreign commodities will increase in the like manner; because their consumption is continually increasing, and their industry, as well as their wealth, is continually advancing. Their real price, therefore their real wealth and subsistence, will naturally be continually increasing.

It is otherwise in old trades. In a state, for want of a better word, of civil war, of a national discord, of some violent interruption of commerce, it may sometimes be difficult to get any money price for old goods, which had before been commonly paid in new ones. The money-price of the greater part of manufactures is in this case necessarily lower than before the interruption of commerce, or even during the continuance of the civil war. In such cases, though the real price of the commodity is the same, the quantity which can be purchased with it is necessarily less. It is the money-rent, or what remains of the profit of the stock employed about the business of manufacture after deducting what is

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 49

necessary for replacing the capital employed in its cultivation, which pays this profit. It does not seem necessary that it should always be the same as this, though, in some places, the profits are commonly so; but it must be such as may enable the undertaker of any great work to continue the trade, at least for a considerable time together, with a profit of at least the ordinary level. If the price of this workmanship should rise somewhat, this profit will necessarily be greater or less; but the difference must be no greater than the ordinary variation of wages.

If the demand for stockings, therefore, should ever diminish, the workmen would probably find some other employment for the surplus produce of their industry; and, if the demand continued to grow gradually more and greater, the profits of their stock-work might increase still further. But if the demand for stockINGS continued always the same, the same proportion of stockings would probably be produced, and consequently of the same value; and the same proportion would likewise remain of the profits. The same quantity of stock, therefore, employed with the same profit would always buy the same quantity of stockings; and the demand, though increasing in all the same ways, could always be supplied by a smaller number of stockholders, who would be obliged, therefore to sell them for a smaller price. The same number of stockholders, on account of this smaller quantity being continually sold, could always dispose of their own stock in the same manner; and their private interest would oblige them to buy them, not with a greater number, but with a smaller number of hands, than before. The profits, too, which had been made by selling with a greater quantity the stock originally employed in making stockings, would, by this reduction of price, fall back upon the stock-jobbing traders, and be no more than the wages of their labour; and this, again, would obligee them to buy their stock with a greater number, or with less stock, than before. But as this reduction of price, too, must have occasionED this greater and more rapid improvement in the condition of the people in general, it must have occasioned something like an augmentation, in some respects, both in the real wealth of the country, and in that of the inhabitants of London, in the quantity of useful labour which was maintained by it, and in the quantity of revenue which was brought in from it.


CHAPS

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 50

. I. and II.The power and authority of the corporation, and the privileges of trade, granted under this act of parliament, are in some respects different from those which they enjoyed under the old system, or which were conferred upon them under their ancient charters, and are, therefore, in a great measure uncertain and indefinite.¾The power and authority, however, are very much the same; for the trade, privileges, regulations, &amps;ci; which the corporation grants under this act of parliaments, necessarily imply the same powers and privileges, and may, without any qualification or restriction, be taken and enjoyed by all other traders in the same manner as those granted under other charters.

 CHAPS. III., IV. & V.In the different articles of trade, the different restraints imposed upon apprenticeship and registration, seem to have been originally intended to prevent abuses, by rendering the whole body of apprentices liable, without exception, to every arbitrary regulation which was thought proper to be imposed by a corporate body for the government of a particular trade, of the same nature with what is called corporation law in other countries; and to hinder them from running away, in order to evade the law. The different articles of apprenticeship, however (for there are many), are not all alike arbitrary; and the regulations of apprenticeship are, perhaps in most cases, quite arbitrary, and consequently subject both the apprentice, and his employer, both to all the abuses to which the law itself, or any other regulations, could give occasion. The regulations of the corporation of workhouses, though more liberal in general than those of the guild of smiths and weavers (which are themselves, in many respects, more liberal), are still, upon this account considered, more arbitrary than those of the greater part of other corporations, and, in reality, have no other effect than that of making the whole body, both of workmen, and of masters, run away from one another, and from the employment which is given them, in order to seek that for which they are not fitted, but are obliged, by this very liberty, to become fit.¾The regulations of the great undertaker and manufacturer, however, though less arbitrary than the regulations of the greater part, and, consequently, more likely, too, to give occasion to such abuses as those above described, are still, in reality more arbitrary, and have no other other effect

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 51

, but that of making every man run as fast as he can to get out from under the dominion of his employer. The great manufacturers of both sexes, in order to avoid these abuses altogether, endeavour, in their different branches, to make the most exact inspection and direction possible; to oblige all their workpeople, even apprentices and journeymen, to give their masters notice of all their intention to quit their respective jobs upon reasonable notice being served; and if this is not done within six months after such service, to give notice thereof, and, if the person does quit before this, and upon reasonable warning being given, to take the goods which are at that time in the workhouse to be delivered up to the owner. But this regulation of the great manufacturer does not extend to his servants; for they have, in many cases no such legal right of inspection, nor are their employers obliged to afford any such warning.

It has been the constant policy of Europe, accordingly, in all ages of its history, to encourage, as much as possible, the establishment of manufactures by corporations, by granting to such manufactures certain monopolies, which they call bye-licenses or exclusive privileges, sometimes upon very slender conditions; sometimes upon much more slender ones, sometimes upon very easy terms, but always upon very easy terms, and upon conditions so extremely permissive, that almost all the work which any particular workman does not himself undertake, can be done, either by another workmen, who are willing and able to work for less pay, or by a free labour company, who are not only willing, and able to work for much less, but are, upon many different accounts, readily allowed by the law to exercise this exclusive privilege, upon conditions much less humiliating than any that the great manufacturer might think proper. In France, the exclusive privileges of trades which concern foreign commerce are granted upon much less slender terms, and upon much more easy conditions, than the privileges of those of which the work is principally carried upon domestic industry.

In Scotland the privileges granted to corporations, as well as to individuals, are very permissive. The statute of apprenticeships in all corporations, and the corporation laws of England, in particular, give great encouragement to those corporations which establish apprenticeship schemes. The privileges of the great corporation of Edinburgh, which grants them to all its members upon very moderate conditions, are very liberally bestowed. In Scotland, the privileges of corporations are, the more common thing

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 52

, confined to particular towns, where they can exercise them with much greater freedom than at large. They are not liable, therefore to the visit or inspection of the crown; and their members are, in general, more secure of their property than is the case in England.
The privileges of corporation were introduced into England by the act which established the corporation laws in England. It was enacted that no freehold should in future be granted, either by gift, devise, or purchase; that all freeholders, both male and female, should be incapable of alienation; that all freeholders should have no power of making bye-law for their respective members, or of dividing or selling the whole or any part either of their own lands or houses, or of granting leases for terms of years; and that, upon such leases, the lessee should have no other right to dispose of his share, but in such manner as the said freeholders might think proper. It seems, however, from the experience of many years, not unreasonable that these privileges should not always be necessary, and that, if any one of the above-mentioned rights were granted, that all other rights of the same kind should be taken away. In the course of a few years after the act was made, some considerable alterations were accordingly recommended, of which the principal seem to have been as follows: First, the right of alienation was taken away; secondly, that of granting a bye-law for the management of the affairs of a particular lodge was taken off the hands only of a few, who had previously been appointed to it by the general assembly; thirdly, the privilege of dividing houses was taken away; fourthly, the lease for terms of many years was rendered inoperative by a new clause added to it. The first three alterations, though not of very long continuance, seem, however (I have been informed), to have been the most popular of all the proposals.

The four following alterations, of which the most important seem, I believe, to have been introduced in consequence of this particular act which gave corporations their rights, were probably the original causes of those four great privileges.

First. That every freeholder, whether he be male, or female (for there is no distinction of sex in Scotland), may, for his own security and advantage (and, I apprehend, for the good order of the lodge), appoint two of his neighbours, and each of them a second, as his officers

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 53

for keeping the public roads, for preventing the carrying of goods from place to place, for the inspection of goods coming into the town, and so for all the other duties which the officers of police can lawfully discharge themselves of.
The overseer or watch-man may likewise, upon proper warning being given him by one of his two superiors, and he having first obtained leave of court, assemble a company, of which the master and several of his equals are to be members, under the command of an overseer or master constable; the whole being under the inspection and superintendency of an officer of the police, who, though a member of the lodge, is subject to the discipline of it, and to the authority of the master constable. The lodge being once established, the officers may afterwards be removed, and the whole business of the police committed to a committee, which is, in Scotland, always under a master constables. The lodge, however, may not always be under the immediate inspection of such committee, for sometimes it may be convenient to keep a part of its proceedings in secret, and for the purpose only of making a show of executing the laws. The committee, however (for there may sometimes not be a single committee of any kind in Scotland) must be informed, in the usual way, of every thing which they shall find, either in the lodge, or in their neighbourhood. They may then, upon reasonable cause, remove the master or overseers, if they think proper; but, in that case, the committee must inform them, at least in writing, of the removal, and must require them to appear before it, within a reasonable period (three months), before a committee of three justices, of whom one must always be a master, and two such as are either masters themselves or have served in that capacity. The committee, after having heard both sides, may, if the master and overseers fail to appear, remove the master constable, if he thinks proper. The lodge, however, being once established in this manner (and, as I believe, in every country where it takes place), cannot well fall into disuse; and the police being once thoroughly established in it, the officers may afterwards be removed from one lodge, as they may think proper, and be replaced by new ones, as may happen to arise; the lodge being, in this case, no doubt under the immediate and continual inspection of such committee, who are themselves

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 54

always under the immediate and continual inspection and superintending of the master mason, or of one or more other committee members. The officers, besides, being now altogether strangers to the lodge and its secrets, must not only be more careful, but they may, upon that account, more easily be induced to become coadjutORS, or, what comes nearly to same thing, partners, in any undertakings of the lodge; and the committee being, for these two reasons, generally much more respectable than they were before, may easily persuade the lodge to give them a share of its secret. The lodge is in general much more attentive to the instructions of the officers of its secret than it ever was to those either of an exclusive company, or of any other private society, whose members are not supposed even to belong 




 


To conclude, then, this long digression concerning corporations, and the internal government of their particular establishments. It will be seen, in what order the different operations of such corporations are to be carried on.
The officers of such companies have, in general (though there may occasionally happen some variations in this particular point of their regulations), no authority beyond what arises from that authority which they possess over their own respective workman; that authority consisting partly in the right of purchasing the work of other workman, or, in other words, in the power to command, and in the right, too, to punish, when it becomes requisite for them to do this. But this right to command, or, as we say, this privilege of purchasing, can never extend beyond the limits of the particular trade in which the workman is employed. If he violates the regulations of his particular lodge, he is not likely to be much disturbed by the officers of the corporation. The privileges, besides, by which he acquires the right of purchasing the work, may extend to other trades; and if the workman violates any of those of his neighbours, he may be threatened, perhaps, with a forfeiture of his right, if the company think it worth while that he should continue in the trade in which he has engaged.
The officers, therefore, having no right, and being altogether incapable either of buying or of commanding, are altogether incapable of regulating the trade of any other person; or even of restraining the violence, if one may say, of robbing any other persons who may attempt, without violence, to regulate it for themselves, or

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 55

to carry on a foreign trade with their goods.

It may be necessary that such a foundation of authority, besides the salaries of the superior officers, and of the clerks and journeymen, who are necessarily employed in preparing the goods which the merchants carry from place-to-place, and in transporting them, either to distant warehouses, or from those distant warehouses to nearer markets; also a certain number, at least of sailors or carriers, to carry those goods to those markets, must always accompany the merchant, who, in return, expects, that they, in return, shall receive the like recompence from the consumers. But the sailors, if the goods were of no value in the country where they are brought, would soon desert him. He can have nothing but his labour and stock to live upon. The carriers are his servants. They are, in this case, as completely independent of him, or as incapable of defending or governing him, as the sailors are in the case of a masterless slave, or of any freeman of inferior rank and fortune.
30. The wages of the inferior ranks, too, must be sufficient, not only to maintain, without interruption, the labourers, journeymen and journeymen's servants, and the menial servants, who assist them; but likewise the overseer, who, with his family, maintains himself and his family, in the same manner as other artificers and manufacturers maintain themselves; and the overseers of all those subordinate servants, in the like proportion, provided they are all men, and are paid equally, or in the proportion of an equal.


31. In every civilized society, there are always a few rich people who have both stock and credit sufficient to carry on their own undertakings. These possess both a capital sufficient, not only to employ their own stock and credit, but a quantity, too large for any body else to employ in the like manner; a quantity, too, which it is always difficult for them, or at least very inconvenient for them to dispose either of, or to know where to find. The quantity of stock, therefore they can seldom be disposed of without giving some considerable part of it up. They are, therefore, always willing, and, from motives of benevolence, often eager, to lend money to other poor people. Their interest, therefore (for they are always interested in what concerns themselves only), oblige the lenders, not only frequently to lend, but

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 56

frequently to take such a risk as must necessarily expose them to the risk, not only of losing their money, or paying it back, in any event, in less than its full value, but of incurring an expense, greater even than the loss, in order that the creditor may be repaid in full, with the ordinary profit.

It is the interest of the lender, therefore, to reduce as far as he possibly can the rate at which he lends. If the interest is high, and the risk is low; and the borrower, instead of making a neat capital of two or three hundred, should have occasion to make a neat capital of one thousand, or of ten thousand pounds only: his interest would certainly be very much reduced; his risk, too, being greatly increased, in proportion as his capital was increased; and the lender, in order that the borrower might make a neat capital as great or greater than before (by saving, for example, two per cents upon every hundred pounds borrowed), would have occasion to expose him to a much greater risk, and consequently to some very great losses.

The lender's interest, therefore (by restraining the increase in the quantity, as well, as the price of money) tends necessarily to raise the rate of profit, and consequently the rate at whose expense it is laid.

It is not the interest, however (for there is no such thing), of the borrower, to make any neat capital, but to make as great a capital as the lender will allow him; and this maxim has always rendered the lending trade more profitable than that of the borrower, even in those ancient and barbarous times, when the interest and credit of individuals were very low. The interest of the lender, however, is not always so directly opposed, it seems, as that of the debtor. In ancient times the debtor, it has already been observed, was not obliged, like us, to make a neat profit upon his money. The interest upon a sum of ten thousand sestertii was not only no more than a tenth part, or fourpence, on every ten thousand, but was commonly only one half penny upon the hundred. In the progress, too, of improvement, the interest upon a sum of ten thousand, it is evident, must naturally increase, and become as much a twentieth, or a fourth part, upon every thousand. In the course of improvement, therefore the profits of the lending trade, though somewhat

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 57

higher in proportion to the quantity of money lent than those of the other two trades, gradually diminish, and, in the course of the next century, become so much less so, that, in the greater portion of the commercial world, they may be regarded as nearly equal to those of the other two. In France, the ordinary profit of lending, at three per cent. is supposed, upon the whole stock of money which a private man lends at one time or another, to be more than double the ordinary rate, or six times the ordinary rate, which he can afford to take, upon the same stock. But this great profit cannot be made, unless the interest which he pays upon it, bears some proportion, or is paid with some other proportionable part of his profit. It cannot be so, if it bears no such proportion, because, if it did, the lender would soon find that he could not afford to take any more money upon that stock, and would be obliged to sell his whole share in order to get out again as fast a money lender.

In England, upon the whole, it is said, the ordinary profits, both upon the ordinary and extraordinary loans, do not exceed five per cent. Upon the ordinary, the interest is generally between four and five per cent.; and upon extraordinary occasions the rate is commonly as high as eight, nine or ten per cent. The ordinary profits of lending, therefore, are said to be as high as twenty-five, thirty or forty per cent. in the greater part of our towns and cities, which are supposed, at this day, to be thriving commercial cities. But in France, the average profits of all the different banking trades, both upon ordinary and extraordinary loans are said to amount only, upon an average of the last five years, to six or seven, sometimes to five and four, in some particular trades. In the greater part of France, the lending trade is not only thriving, but well established, while in England it seems not to have been well established for more than two or two-thirds of the present period. The French banking trade, accordingly, has, in proportion, both in number and value of trades, much superior to the English; and it has accordingly had, in all those countries where the trade has been better cultivated, a much greater superiority of advantage over that of England. In France, besides, there is no private lender who does his business by retail; whereas in Great Britain

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 58

, where the law gives a considerable encouragement, a great number are obliged to do so. In both parts, therefore, there must be a great overcharge of interest, and consequently, a great undercharge in every particular trade, in order that those particular trades should be carried 


¼

In France, besides, there is no personal banker who deals by retail. All money-lenders must be licensed by the state, which, it is supposed, renders their dealings much more secure. The parish clerk of each parish has a particular licence to deal by wholesale, and is obliged to give it in writing, before he begins to lend his money. In England, the practice is not less dangerous, and, upon that accounts, less common; because it can be done without any license, which is, in most places, very difficult to obtain.
The parish clerk, too, must have a special licence, too, to deal in his own particular trade. If, in consequence of any such regulation as I have been just now speaking about (which is very different in different parishes), the price of the commodity which he sells is higher in the market of one than in that which he buys, the interest which is paid by the borrower upon the whole capital advanced by him must be greater than if it had been the same in both. If the price is the one hundredth, or the twenty-fourth part, more, therefore, it will be the seventy or ninety per cent., or eight or ten per cent., greater than if the same price had been in both. This is the difference which, in most cases, makes up for the difference of price in every two different markets, and which makes the interest of lending in the one way more advantageous, than lending in the other. The interest, therefore, must generally be more disadvantageous, not only in France and Great Britain, where there are few personal bankers to deal by retail, but even where there is no regulation to hinder it. The parish clerk, however, who lends by wholesale, must always have the same licence to do so. He is not only obliged to give that licence, but is obliged to watch over the payment of that interest, which he is bound to enforce by fine and imprisonment, as the strictest of all exactions, in the same manner, I imagine, as the custom of wearing black clothes in summer. The parish clerk,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 59

it is said, was averse even to sign the register, which, as it recorded every sale, every purchase, every deed of alienation, was necessarily a record both more complete and less circumstanced than any written deed, and which could not be tamper with but by a particular permission of that superior. The parish register was, upon this account, kept by a particular constable or bailiff, and was, upon this account, carefully guarded. The constables, it is to be observed, had no other means of enforcing the execution of such contracts but by the sword; and the bailiffs had, besides this, the power of levying the necessary fine. The parish register was thus, by all accounts, extremely safe from being tamperwith; and, for these reasons, it was the instrument by which the great mercantile houses in England were for a long period of time enabled to establish, at their pleasure, the monopoly of the trade of the colony. The establishment of this monopoly necessarily gave birth, too, to that spirit, of arbitrary and monopolizing government, of the absolute command which, for many centuries after the discovery of the West Indies, took possession of all the inferior ranks and orders of people in all new colonies; a command which, if not restrained by law, soon degenerates, as we shall see hereafter, into a total despotism.

In consequence of this exclusive privilege, however, the colony merchants were enabled to raise the rate of their goods in every market in the mother country as high as they thought proper. They did this by establishing a sort of monopoly in the customs, and in all other markets, in consequence, not of a legal regulation, but, what was much more effectual and decisive, of an express clause in their charter from Queen Elizabeth, that they might raise their own duties as high as they thought proper. This clause is found nowhere else in the English statute book, and is probably the original source of the present custom in the colonies, which obliges all foreign goods imported by British subjects, whether British or foreign goods, to be declared free upon demand, upon proof being given to the collector of the custom, that the goods belong to British subject.

It was upon this account, that in all those ancient and thriving colonies, which were originally established upon a plan similar to that by which Great Britain has hitherto maintained the trade of her West India islands, there has been no competition among the different classes

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 60

or orders of merchants, and the wages of labour have always been much higher in the one than in the others. In the countries to which these colonies belong, it seems to have been usual for a particular order of people, the traders, to erect forts, castles, and other fortifications, in the most unwhallish part of the country, where they could best guard and defend their own monopoly against any other body of men. They were not afraid that their competitors should make any pretence to settle in the neighbourhood, and they did nothing to encourage such settlements. In those remote countries of the world where the commerce of nations is carried on chiefly in ships of war, it has generally been the merchants, who have collected the most considerable stocks and provisions for such occasions; because they could afford to buy them dearest. In such countries the trade is, the greater part either, carried upon by means of foreign goods brought in from foreign countries; or by those goods, sent from foreign lands, loaded with some duty, which, when they arrived at a port where they had been warehoused, the dealers could dispose of to their own people with a good profit. Such a state of things naturally produces in the merchants, a disposition to enlarge, as much as possible, their own capitals, in order to enable them, with the greatest possible profit, both to bring in such goods as are likely either to be more expensive, and consequently more valuable than those they are bringing, or less expensive and less so. It naturally promotes, therefore, the improvement and cultivation of their own country, in the same manner, if I may be allowed the expression of a vulgar and ignorant writer of this kind (though he does not pretend that he has been able to discover the real causes of it, and is rather apt, perhaps to represent it as the natural effect, or as the necessary consequence of those causes, the natural increase of the mercANTile system), as the improvement of the roads and navigable canals, and of the harbour-ships, the great engines of the commerce of a great empire; the improvement, in short, both of the inland, and, what is of still greater importance in a country such as Great Britain, of the maritime provinces, which are the most important for supplying the whole empire with its produce. It naturally promotes both the carrying trade and that branch of inland commerce which is carried on in merchant vessels; the trade, however carried on by the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 61

merchants themselves, being always less advantageous. It tends, therefore to diminish, rather than to increase the competition, or the number of competitors for every piece of inland commerce. The monopoly, too, which a town-corner, or even a principal town, enjoys over its whole neighbourhood, naturally tends to reduce the competition, not only for all the goods of the town-corner, which are carried thither by the inhabitants, and sold at the market, but for all those of that part of it which is employed in manufacturing, or in the supplying of foreign countries with their manufactures, and which, consequently, supplies those foreign countries, not with the like quantity of goods as they themselves produce, but with somewhat less, and, in consequence, sells them cheaper. The monopoly of a great manufacture in any particular place, and the discouragement given to that manufacture by a small neighbouring town, necessarily tend to reduce, more or less, the competition for the produce  of that particular manufacture, and to encourage the industry of the neighbouring towns. In Scotland the exclusive trade of Glasgow has been supposed to do this very properly.

In some places the natural advantages of a town to the carrying trade, are such as naturally dispose it either to establish itself as an exclusive trading-port, or to draw all its shipping into a single channel; the ports which lie round about it, being naturally so situated as to be both the greatest in bulk, and the most convenient for loading and unloading all the ships of which the inhabitants are capable. In other cases the advantage is not so natural; but, on the contrary, the town has neither the capital, nor the inclination, to become such a trading- port. In those circumstances it must content itself with the ordinary privileges of a town-corner; the exclusive trade of the town, or the discouragements given to its inhabitants to trade in any other manner. In those which are in between, it is obliged either to content itself, or to content itself less than any of those other two circumstances.

The terms of the exclusive privilege granted by the king of Denmark to the city of Copenhagen, seem to indicate the nature of the circumstances in question, and to indicate what are the ordinary privileges, or, in other words what the town is allowed to call its own, in its own neighbourhood, without being obliged either, first, either, to build or maintain a harbour, for the carrying trade of which the town was capable;

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 62

or, secondly, either to furnish or pay any duty to government in consequence of this employment; or, thirdly, to make any improvement upon land which was within the city walls.

It is the monopoly of a harbour, therefore (which the inhabitants of all such towns have always sought), which gives them that exclusive privilege of calling their town a harbour, or, in other language speaking, of calling it by a peculiar name which no other people can take from it; and which enables them, without any injustice, to exclude all other traders and settlers, either altogether or in proportion to what they may be supposed to be worth.


 ART. III.

Of Commerce, and the Policy of encouraging it among the Poor People, or those who Live upon their Profits.

 The policy, therefore, which should regulate the trade of such a town in order to give it that monopoly of calling itself a port or harbor, should be judged of, not by its riches or its greatness, but, what in this particular branch of business deserves the greatest attention, its poverty.

The commerce of a port or a harbour is necessarily confined to what can come into it from the country, or, more properly speaking from that part 

 ART. IV.¾Of the Policy of excluding Foreign Trade, from every town which is not already well Commercialized, and which has no proper facility for bringing in foreign manufactures, and of promoting that Commercialization by all means in its power.

The commerce of a port or harbour is necessarily confined, first, to what can come into the port from the country which lies opposite to it; secondly, and, last of all, to what can come from that part of it, which is within it, or from that which lies round about it. It can never extend beyond these limits, but must necessarily end in some one or another of those two limits, either in being excluded from that part, or being subjected to some duties which are imposed by law for the support and encouragement of that part of it which lies round about the port.

Such ports or harbours, therefore, are always, either in their present state of unwholesomenetization, or in their advanced state, naturally and necessarily divided into two parts, the country which lies opposite to the port, on the one side, and that part which lies round about the port, and which, though not yet entirely commercial, yet has

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 63

become, or may become, so, on account of some improvement of commerce in that country, on the other side; and the country, or part of a country which lies round the port, on the one side, and that, which is situated between those two parts, on the other side, becomes gradually less commercial, or may become still less so. The greater the distance, therefore, which divides those two parts, the smaller must necessarily be the number of shipping which can be employed in transporting the surplus produce of one from one end of it to another; and this diminution of shipping, as well as the diminution in the value of all commodities, must in time necessarily reduce, or rather destroy, that value. The greater part of the manufactures of Great England consist in the manufacture of goods for distant markets. If the greater part of those manufactures were to go abroad, to Holland, or to some foreign country which lies round about the Mediterranean sea; if, by some improvement of navigation, a passage could easily be made, not only from England to those countries, but from those countries, too (for it is only with a great port of England that any part of them could be exported), they would probably, in the long-run (which, in the present circumstances of the British trade, it is not very likely to be), diminish still further the quantity and value of those commodities which can be sent out by means either, of the greater or of the smaller port of London; and the trade which is thus gradually destroyed, will probably, sooner than any man imagines (I do believe that I speak with great authority upon this point), be entirely swallowed away, and annihilated altogether. The port of England, indeed, though it is by no mean a monopoly, yet, by being the only port which connects Great Britain with the countries which lie round the Mediterranean sea, it gives a particular value to a part of the produce of its inland commerce, which no monopoly can give. But if this part of the produce is destined for distant markets, the greater part, too, of it will necessarily go to those markets, from the greater distance of which, besides the port of England, there is scarce any thing which comes much nearer to the place where it is produced. If, on the contrary, a part of this part was destined to be consumed at home; if the greater part, too, of the goods destined to be exported, were to consist of such rude

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 64

produce as could easily be transported from the farm, to which it was intended to belong; the farmer, who had the management and command, would soon have less occasion for any other man but himself to cultivate the land, to collect and bring to market such goods of the most varied kind as he could. He would soon be enabled, therefore, either, first to raise a smaller quantity of food at his own expense; or to send a greater proportion of that which had been thus produced, to market, at the expense only of his landlord. The farmer would soon be enabled, in both these ways, to pay a smaller rent to the landlord. The price of his corn, therefore, and of the commodities upon which it is made use of in the kitchen of the kitchen, would naturally be lower than it is in our times; because the farmer would be obliged, for the same reason, to sell them at a smaller price at the foreign market. The rent, however, which, according to the ancient law of England, paid to every lord in the country, and which is called its neat rent, was supposed to be precisely in proportion, not to what the landlord could afford, or what his farm could afford to him, or even to what the produce of that produce might otherwise bear, but rather to what the produce was supposed to be worth in foreign markets, was, according to the modern system, to consist altogether, not in this, but in what the produce might bear in foreign markets.


 CHAP. VII.

OF THE RENT OF CITIES. The rent, besides, of cities, is regulated in a great measure, not so much in what may happen to be the produce of their own land, but rather in what is expected to be the rent of their houses. The rent of a house is higher or lower, according to the greater or smaller extent of the ground which is capable of being cultivated by means either, either of an inclosure, or of some sort or other of artificial drains or moats.

A city which has acquired all that is necessary for supporting a considerable number of inhabitants in the way of houses, has generally, in proportion to what it has acquired, acquired, not only a greater quantity of land to cultivate; but a greater or less degree of luxury, and of refinement and elegance in every sort of house-work. A house of moderate rent in the present times, is said not to deserve this name in

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 65

the days when it was built. In those ancient times it would have been worth the labour of building; and a small quantity of good wine would probably, in those times have bought a great quantity of work.

But the rent which the landlord can afford to give, is regulated by the profit of his stock; which is in this case regulated by the interest of that stock. It varies with every variation in the price either of the land, or of what is called the produce of the land. If it rises in one year from ten pounds a year to twelve or thirteen pounds, the landlord will generally be glad of the change; but if it falls in the next, from thirteen pounds to ten pounds, he will be more likely, upon the same circumstances which gave occasion to it, to lament the misfortune. The rent, therefore, must always bear a regular relation to the produce, and must be paid in proportion, not only to that, which, according to common estimation, is the highest in the particular year, and which may happen sometimes to be somewhat above, and sometimes to be somewhat BELOW that rate; and not only in proportion, but according to some particular rule of estimation. The produce, in consequence of a greater abundance, will generally, upon all ordinary occasions, be somewhat higher than in consequence of a less abundant one. The produce will be greater in consequence, not of the increase of rent, which, in the one case is always the same; but of the increase of stock, in which case the increase is not only different from, but opposite to, that in the one case. The rent will be greater, not in consequence of any rise of profit, in the one case; but in that of stock, in the other, because in the one case there was no increase in the quantity of good, which, according 

The price of wine has sunk in proportion to that of bread. The rise, however (according to the common notion) of price is not always the cause, but the consequence of the fall in quality; and it happens, too, frequently that a very small rise in price occasions, more or fewer, a very great fall of quality. The quality, therefore the quantity, of the commodities, which are sold for money, must bear a certain relation, both in quantity and in quality, both to what can commonly be got by labour, and to what can commonly be had only by extraordinary profit; to what can be got

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 66

, not merely by the ordinary rate of profit in all trades, but, in consequence either of the nature or circumstances, of that particular trade, to the extraordinary profit which is sometimes to be made by it, or to its peculiar advantage over other branches, in the competition with which it must necessarily be carried upon, in the home market. The price, accordingly, of tobacco in the West Indies, though it varies very considerably in different years and places, is always higher in years when the demand for tobacco is most abundant, than in those which are generally most scantily supplied, as was well known to Sir Matthew Decker in the year 1722, and to his own knowledge has frequently been verified by the accounts of several different ships, of which the returns were received between 1745, 1748 and 1800, from the ports of Brazil and the Brazils, where, notwithstanding the extraordinary plenty which happened in those respective years (for the Spanish government, in their turn, had prohibited the ex-portation of tobacco, and consequently of its produce), the price of the commodity has, upon several occasions in these different times, been very much depressed, in consequence of such severe winters, which have obliged the growers to sell their corn at a much lower value, than they otherwise would have done.

The prices of corn in England, during these ten or twelve years past, seem, in general (though they may have been somewhat exaggerated by the badness of the season, which, in many parts of the country has been very great), not much lower in the summer than they have ever been, except during these ten or twelve years past; and, during those ten years past, they have been, perhaps, somewhat better. But the scarcity occasioned by these last ten years, and which, notwithstanding the extraordinary plenty of tobacco which took places during those eleven or twelve years, still subsists in some part of the kingdom, has, no 

 


L.2.


 L.2. Tobacco and Sugar together, are by far the two principal productions, which contribute the most, either directly or by their effects, to the annual consumption, or, what is nearly the same thing, the revenue, of every country. The produce of tobacco, however, it is to be observed, though it may not be the most valuable part of the produce, yet, as the whole is consumed by a great nation at less expense than the greater part of other produce,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 67

its consumption must be more extensive than that of any other part.


 CHAP. III.


OF THE PRODUCE AND PROCESS OF CULTURE, OR OF THOSE ARTIFICIAL OR IMPROVED PRODUCTS OF NATURE, WHETHER OR NOT MANUALLY OR PROCESSICLY MIXED UP WITH OATMAIN, BARLEY, OR CANNABIS, AS THE PRINCIPLE OF MANUFACTURING THEM PRODUCS, IS ATTAINED BY ARTIFICERS, IN AN UNKNOWN OR UNUSED FORM.

 ART. I.Of the Manufactures of Agriculture.

The first and principal manufacture of every civilized society, of which any account has ever yet been given in the works on ancient history or ethnology, consists, not so much in a material, or in some particular part of an animal, or in some sort of rude produce, such as fire, earth, or sea-weed; but, on the contrary, in some particular quality or characteristic peculiar to that species of rude produce, such, perhaps, as the hardiness or toughness, as the marvellous beauty, as the flavour or savour, or as the agreeable or agreeable qualities which are inseparably united with them. Such manufactures are of three different kinds. First of these, and perhaps of all, are those which are made from the rude produce of land. The rude produce of land is everywhere the most abundant. The corn field produces, in the greater part of the British dominions, more food for men and cattle, and consequently more work, and, in proportion to its bulk, the greater part of its value; but, in the mean time (for it is a mean, and, consequently a small portion, of the produce), it is the most difficult of any. The wheat field, too, though less plentiful than the barley, produces, in almost every country, a greater quantity of food for men, and consequently a greater quantity of labour, than the greater part of other rude produce of the same kind. But, in order to make the greater part either 






 The first and principal manufacture, of every civilization which has ever been discovered, consists, neither in a particular part of an unmodified rude, such, perhaps as the bowstring or the eye-glass of a bow, or the hair of a sheep; nor

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 68

even in such a part, but in a particular sort of unmodified rude. It is a particular sort, indeed, of rude, which has, for its object the production of something useful to man; but a useful something which, as it were, complements and supports the other useful sorts, of which it itself is a sort. In every society, accordingly the manufactures which are carried on in the towns and country villages, consist chiefly in this one sort of unmodified rude; and the greater part of those manufactures have been invented, or at least adopted from some foreign society, in which this one was peculiarly employed, or in which the demand for it was peculiarly great. The manufacture, accordingly, which consists chiefly in such rude productions as are the immediate instruments of commerce, and which are the materials of dress and lodging for men and women, is the principal manufacture which has ever been introduced into any society; and this manufacture has been, in every civilized country of which we can trace the history, a very ancient manufacture, of which some parts, however, must always have gone before it.

The difficulty which this species of industry, therefore, has always had in finding buyers, has always arisen, first, from the want of a demand for the produce, which the industry itself produces without labour or expense, and, consequently, for no wages, or for what are called profit on the stock employed in its cultivation and improvement; and, secondly, and lastly, and most commonly, from the impossibility or absurd impropriation of purchasing that produce, by means either (a) the exclusive privilege of one particular person or class of people, over the whole society, or ( b) by a certain tax or land-tax, upon the produce, either, both, perhaps, together or separately, of all the lands in the society. Such obstructions, however, as these have been, and they have been chiefly such obstructs of the political kind; they are, in reality, obstructions of no nature, but only obstructions which, in a civilized society, are the necessary and unavoidable consequences, not merely, but of a great revolution in government, and in every branch, either, of agriculture or of manufactures. The difficulty of buying, therefore, which this manufacture necessarily meets with every day in any society, arises from two different sources: first from its not having a demand in that society for its own price; secondly from the impossibility of paying for its

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 69

own consumption. In every society, therefore, the demand must arise partly from the want of something else to give for it, or partly, what arises from its own consumption being so much overstocked in proportion to what can be employed in it; the demand of those people who cannot give any thing for their stone but what can easily be had for theirs. The difficulty arises, first, in the scarcity of the materials which it is necessary for the workmen either either to collect themselves or to procure for them; and, secondly, in the want both of materials which can easily come into competition, and of wages sufficient for purchasing them. In a country where the produce of all sorts is in great plenty, the materials which are wanted are generally to be found; but in one which is very thinly inhabited and well cultivated the materials for building are scarce to be met with, and the wages of labour seldom so high as in one where there is a greater abundance of such materials, though they may frequently be higher in one of the poorer countries, such as Spain or Italy, than they are at present. The materials for building, therefore (for it must always depend on this), will naturally, the greater the plenty, afford less rent, the greater will be its demand, while that for the instruments of trade and manufactures is necessarily more or less increased by the scarcity of those materials, by the want both of the people who live near them, who want to employ them, and of the people who have either occasion to buy, to sell, or to borrow them. The demand of those two orders, however, is not in this case directly regulated by their real poverty, or even their real wealth; because their real poverty is seldom greater, or even equal to the demand of those who have the surplus of the necessaries and comforts, of the materials of their industry, over and beyond their own consumption. It is, on account of this deficiency of the necessaries and conveniencies of the necessaries and comforts of the poor, that the wages of labour are commonly higher than in wealthier countries; and the demand of the poor for those necessaries, conveniencies, and luxuriance, makes the demand for those higher wages.
The scarcity of the materials of the work, and the want of the labourer's subsistence, which, in every society, necessarily occasion the difficulty in getting those materials for their use, are the causes, it is to be hoped, both which,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 70

and which only, make this species of rude industry, properly so called.

In every civilized society, the labour of a husbandmen consists chiefly in preparing the materials which he intends to use either for his own consumption or that of other people. His wife, and, what is the same thing, his master, look upon him as a man who is employed upon a particular project; they do not regard his work as a mere appendage to his life; they do regard, however, the price of the work which he does as an object to which, if they could get it for any price, they would always sell it for the highest. The price which he gets from them is, in most countries, a sufficient compensation to the stock which employs him, together with the ordinary profits of stock, which is commonly about three or four per cent., and sometimes more. In the progress of improvement the quantity of materials, therefore which he can prepare in the course  of a year, increases very fast, and the labour of a labourer becomes, and probably always has been, much more extensive than at first. But the price of those materials, as they increase in value so must likewise their consumption, and this increase of consumption is, in the greater or less part of cases (depending on different circumstances), the principal cause, or, more exactly, the principal motive, for the increase of his wages. It seems to be the principal cause; but the motive, though real and important to the labourer, is not always immediately perceptible to the master. The quantity of materials annually brought from the ground, and of which the consumption is gradually increasing, may be considered as stationary, or at least, so much stationary as may render it impossible for either master or labourers to find any new market for them. Their real price is continually increasing; but its actual amount may be continually changing; and as this change is always in proportion to their increase of quantity, the wages and profit must, upon this account, too be continually changing with the price. The quantity, indeed, which can be employed in preparing one year's materials may, perhaps be very nearly equal 





 

 

The price of the materials may, perhaps be very near to what it is necessary to pay for their complete production; but that which is to be paid, over and above the price of those materials, for the use and maintenance, during a certain number of years, and for

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 71

an equal or greater number of years, must necessarily be greater. It must be greater, therefore, in order to compensate the difference which the market will make, in order either to purchase the commodities at the price at which it can commonly be purchased, or to employ them themselves. The quantity of labour necessary, in order either either either to produce, purchase or dispose of those materials, is necessarily greater in one year than it was the year before; and in the following than it will be in the following. The demand of the inhabitants for such commodities, therefore, must necessarily be more extensive, and their supply more uncertain, the one year, than it will be in the succeeding; and it is this difference, or uncertainty, which regulates, in the price, both that of tin and that which is paid for it, in Peru and in Europe, as well as everywhere else in nature. It is in the price of corn, in the same manner as that of many sorts of tin and other minerals, regulated by this difference in supply. It is in that of all other commodities in the price of which the uncertainty, or, what is equivalent to the same thing in the case of gold and silver, the scarcity, of the annual produce is the foundation and foundation only, and which cannot well be otherwise, than in proportion as that supply is either more or less uncertain.

It is not so much the price of the precious metals, as that of their principal constituent parts, the lapis calaminaris, that regulates that of the whole produce. In every different country in the same, and, I believe in every part, of the world, the quantity of silver, whether coined, or in plate, which is to be found in the rude produce of land and labor, must, in the price of that produce, be regulated in exactly the proportion to that of that which is to go into preparing and bringing it to market; in proportion to that of its price at home, or in the place where it can commonly be had for this price. But in Peru, the value, both of this silver as well as of the precious stones and other ornaments, makes a part of this rude produce; in other countries, of a still smaller part, or of none. In those parts of America which are peopled almost entirely with Indians and Mestizos (a nation of about thirty million, I am assured), there may be found some little bit of Spanish

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 72

tin, which has come from Spain, but which, in the shape either of ingot, plate, girdle, bracelet, ring, or brooch, has not yet come from England. It may be worth while, I think it will, to take a few moments to consider what might have been the consequences, had those pieces, instead of being exported to Spain, been sent to England; and, secondly, to consider what might have been the consequence of the sending of those English goods to Spain instead, as the only market for which they could ever afterwards have been exchanged. The first of these considerations will occupy us no longer. It is sufficient, perhaps, to observe, that the quantity of silver, or, what comes to the same thing, of what can purchase, either the one commodity, or the service of the other, must always be much greater in the one situation than in the others. The greater, therefore, must necessarily have always been the profit, and the smaller, therefore, must necessarily have always been the price paid by those who imported that part of the silver of Europe, of which they had occasion.

In the second and third of the above-mentioned considerations, we have only to do with those commodities, of which the value arises chiefly from their scarcity or plenty; with the necessaries of life; with what is purchased by the labour of those who are maintained by wages, or by the sale of what is produced by the labour, and not, as in manufactures, by that part only of the materials, of the labour of artificers and manufacturers, of the instruments and provisions of agriculture and the fisheries; or in what are sold for the sake of the profit, not for the sake, indeed, of the rent, but of that portion of the rent, which is paid in money or commodities, of which there is a great surplus, and of which, in consequence either of their being manufactured at home or exported to other countries, there is always an abundance in every country, and of which Spain is, in all its provinces, very much in excess. The profits of merchants are commonly very great upon such commodities; because the whole quantity, or the value of the commodities, which can thus be sold, is always much greater than what the whole number, perhaps, of those who have any interest to sell it, can afford to pay in the way of profit. The same causes, however, which dispose men generally, either in

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 73

private life or public office, to prefer the employment which is most agreeable and profitable to themselves, will, upon most ordinary occasions dispose them likewise to neglect the most profitable; or to prefer the more hazardous.

In every civilized country there are always two different employments for which there is always some demand: one of them is a very hazardous and uncertain, and is called the military; and the other is the most certain, and called that of the merchant or tradesmen, who have either the monopoly of the home market, or the command over some great manufactory, which can afford to pay a certain wages. In all those different occupations there is always something to be lost by being absent; and it seldom costs more to employ one man in one of them, even though he should go to the war in the wrong season and in the wrong place; than it does to send him to the trade in the proper time and in proper place. The wages of a soldier are always lower, the hazards more dangerous, than the profits of any mercantile undertaking. The demand for a military force necessarily regulates the price of arms.


 CHAP. IX.¾Of the Expense and Profit of Wars.The Expence and profit both of the maintaining the army in time of peace, and of that in war; of the raising of new troops, of the fortifying and extending old ones, of transporting troops from place to place in time of war, of the paying the soldiers and other officers; of all which things the maintenance of the army constitutes what is properly the expense and profit both of war and peace.
3. Wars are expensive in the maintenance of their principal objects; the materials, the labour, and the stores, which must always, upon most occasions be brought to the field in order to repel an invasion. But in the maintenance either of their principal troops or of those for which they supply them, the ordinary profits of trade are very much inferior. In the maintenance of their principal armies the wages and provisions, therefore, of the soldiers, constitute the whole expense. But the wages, provisions, and other goods, which the merchants and master manufacturers of every civilized society purchase with their money, do not constitute so large a proportion of that money, and are, on the whole, much smaller. In order, therefore, to pay those merchants, masters of every sort and species, the expense, both of the army and of its provisions, the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 74

king must, for some time at least, be able to raise his revenue, or he must, in other ways, make a part of that expense, by allowing a certain proportion of his subjects a free rent upon his lands.

But though the revenue, arising from the duties upon importation, ought always to bear some proportion to the expense which must be defrauded of it, in order to pay those duties; yet, in consequence of some very fortunate circumstances, it is very likely, in the present circumstances of Europe, not only to bear this proportion, but to exceed it. In Great Britain the whole produce of the excise and customs, amounting to upwards of ninety-six millions sterling a-year, are drawn back upon exportation; and though, in the course of a year, more than three-fourths are consumed within the kingdom, yet the revenue, arising from them, does no more than pay, with the surplus over and above the necessary expenses of the civil government of the country, the wages of a great number, perhaps of more than a thousand officers and soldiers; and it is the same officers and soldiers, whose salaries, besides those necessary to maintain their families, are paid by the crown. The whole produce, therefore, of the duties upon importation, is likely to exceed, in this manner, the whole produce of the excise and customs, in proportion to the expense of paying the excise duty, which is drawn down, in the same proportion. In France and Holland the excise, and the greater part even, the duties upon malt and hops, are not drawn back. In these countries, besides those officers and soldiers who are maintained by the crown, there must be paid the salaries of the mandarins and consuls of each province. The whole revenue arising from the different duties, upon the produce of those two commodities, may, in proportion to their actual consumption and consumption within each country, amount to more than three millions sterling. In the British and Dutch colonies there is not only not only not even the smallest revenue derived, but there is not the smallest share even of that share which is paid from that part of it which belongs to the crown.

It has sometimes been pretended, that in countries where the revenue from customs is small, and in which all duties are paid with an exclusive privilege of exporting, the whole revenue derived from those different branches of the revenue of the crown may be very great. In Great Britain, however

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 75

, the assizes of several different sorts of grain were held in the month preceding the feast of All Souls, the most important festival of the Church. This festival, accordingly, was kept very late, in order to allow time for its preparation, and to give the church time for its distribution among all its members, of whom, it is probable, the greater number died before the festival was over, or were not then present. The assize of bread was, in this manner, sometimes held two months after the festival was over, or even two or three years after it had begun; so that, during the whole year, the church might have something to eat and some thing to give away, besides the usual quantity of bread and wine for which the custom of each year required it, according as its own private judgment might judge sufficient. The church, accordingly, in order to make a present of its whole stock of food to the poor, used sometimes both to keep the church door open for a week or two before the festival, in the hope, perhaps, of selling some of its victualled carriages, which were brought in by all the neighbouring lords for that purpose. In those days of great scarcity, it is not unlikely, therefore, that, in many places in England and Scotland, the price of victualled carts and waggon-loads, which were not then much esteemed as commodities, must, upon ordinary occasions, be found a very reasonable one. But though this may have been so in some particular localities; yet, in the general course of things, it seems to have been altogether otherwise in the greater part, both of London, where the carriage-trade is at present principally carried on, as well of other parts, and in the whole commercial country, in which it was then established. The prices paid by those merchants in the greater part of towns for such carriages, when I was there, did, upon every occasion, exceed what was sufficient for purchasing the food which they themselves could consume. It is thus, perhaps (I am, no doubt, going somewhat beyond the bounds of truth), that, in the course of a century or more, the average price, both of victuals and of carts, has generally risen considerably in the great town, and sunk somewhat, I have been assured, both in the remoter parts, in some remote parts, even, of Scotland. It has sunk in some parts so low, as to

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 76

be below the price at the first discovery of the mines; in others it has risen so high, as to make up for this deficiency. The greater the scarcity or plenty, the higher or lower this price must naturally rise or sink. The greater the uncertainty of finding any more silver mines than what have already be wrought in England, or in the other English colonies, the more will naturally be the uncertainty of finding more corn.

Though the value of silver has sunk considerably since that period, its real price has not. Its real price has fallen very much in consequence both, (1) of the extraordinary abundance of corn, and (2) likewise of that of many other productions. It would, however (for these reasons only), be a mistake to infer from thence, that the quantity or the price of that precious metal has increased. The quantity or price of every other commodity, even of the necessaries and comforts of life which we can buy with it, has, in every part of the world, increased considerably during this century; in France more than in any other.

The value of silver has fallen very much in consequence both, (

1. Of the extraordinary abundance of grain, and of many others. The French, in 1764 and 1765, estimated the value of their annual produce at between L.3,600,000 and 4,500,000, the great bulk of which was consumed by cattle and poultry. The British, in 1764, and in 1765, computed it at between L3,500,000 and 4½,600,00 the great mass of which consisted in silver, and of which, therefore, they estimated the value at between L.1,800 and L.4 per cent.; that is, the value of their silver, which had been estimated by the same writers at about eight ounces, or one-fifth of the gross produce, was now supposed by them, at about six ounces only; or at about twenty shilling and seven-penny sterling. The French and British produce is not reckoned the most extensive in the world; the Dutch, the Swedes, Danians and Norwegiennes, being, in proportion to the whole world, perhaps, perhaps the two largest producers in it; but their respective produce is much more confined, as well in quantity as in kind; the former chiefly in the rude, and the latter chiefly manufactured produce; and the difference in the extent of their

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 77

productions is very great. In their respective produce of manufactures, however (for they are all, I believe, very ingenious and superior to the French and English in this particular respect), their manufactures, like those of England, have generally been carried a good deal to excess. The difference, too, in the number, quality, and extent of the different branches of their industry, has, in all countries, been very considerable. In the greater part, perhaps, of the manufactures which they make use either either of iron or of copper as material, they exceed the manufactures which the most extensive empires carry on; such as those of China, Indostan, and Japan. In the greater parts of their linen manufacture they exceed them too; though the materials, it is acknowledged, are not nearly so plentiful as those of China, Indochin, and the East Indies. The difference is greater still in their woollen manufacture; for though the materials, too (for they are all, however, very ingenious in their manner of manufacturing these), they are, in all the greater parts, much inferior to the most extensive empires, such, I believe (I am not sure, indeed), even to the manufactures of England, and to the silk manufactures of Flanders and the northern part, both in their quantity and their excellence. The superiority, however, in all those branches, is very small, it seems, compared with the difference in quantity; and, in the end of the fifth and beginning part of this sixteenth century, when these different branches had all been exhausted, and nothing remained but the most scanty, unskilful, and unwholesome subsistence of the wretched 








 


The difference, too, between the ancient manufactures of England and those which are now established at Amsterdam and Copenhagen, is very great. The English manufactures of that period seem, in all respects equal, or nearly equal, to those of either of those two great commercial towns, though the former were much more extended, both by land, by inland water carriage (the canal and navigable rivers), and, in some respects too (for example, the spinning and knitting of woollen yarn and cloth), even by sea-carriage; while the later manufactures, both those of Scotland, of the north, and of the greater part, of the south of England (for the same reason, I believe, that those which have now taken

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 78

place in the linen manufacture in Flanders are more numerous than those which have ever taken place in the greater portion of the French industry), seem, in all other respect, to be inferior.


In order, however, to give a proper direction to this multiplication of industry, the government was at all times obliged to employ some part, either, of that annual produce of the land and labour of the country, over & above what is necessary for maintaining, first the productive labourers themselves, and afterwards those of the other classes, of artificers and manufacturers, who were employed in supplying them with materials, tools, and wages. This surplus, therefore, was always supposed to belong to some other source, from which the revenue of the society must ultimately arise, or to the rent and profit of some particular land, in order to maintain, either, the cultivators of that land, the labourer, the artificer, or the merchant; or, if you will, those two different sets of productive labourers and cultivators, as they are properly distinguished, though, from different motives and views, both these sets may at any time, be considered together, as the two different sets of consumers of the annual produce. The revenue of the whole society, or of the whole annual produce, it has already sufficiently been shown, must ultimately derive, from whatever source it comes, its value.

The quantity of that produce which the society annually consumes, must, in this case, be supposed to be infinite. It cannot, therefore be increased by any addition, but in consequence either, (a) Of some improvement in agriculture or manufactures; or, (b), Of some increase in its annual revenue; in the one case by an increase in the quantity of food and clothing which it can afford to consume, and in the other by a diminution

LEGAL OBLITERATION, OR OF THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF PRIVILEGES, TO THE PROFIT AND LABOUR OF THE NATIONS. The legal inequality which, in England, is due, either, to the feudal system of government, of entail, and to other ancient restraints upon property, such as those of the ancient Saxon laws; in France, and, I believe, in all other European monarchies, to the absolute sovereignty of the prince or state, seems to be the necessary effect, either, of the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 79

increasing wealth and revenue, of those improvements, of the extension of commerce and industry beyond what they could have been in former times, or, more properly, to be the necessary consequence of them. It necessarily tends to increase, first the real price of labour, and, secondly the quantity of silver, which is employed about it; and to diminish the real value of the annual revenue, both the gross and the net revenue of every particular society.
The legal inequalities, too, of the different orders of men, in all the different provinces of France and England, are not, like those of the inferior ranks of the inhabitants of the same town in ancient Greece and Rome, founded on the natural inequality of birth and fortune; but are founded, in the greater part of them at least, upon a very arbitrary distinction, founded altogether upon the interest of the great proprietors, and extending through all their respective vantages and estates; distinctions, which, in some countries, are so very perfectly understood that, though no law can ever abolish them, no man can well pretend that he has either acquired them himself by good management or good luck, or, on the contrary that he is bound by any duty, obligation, or contract, to maintain them, or to contribute to support them in the possession of those who possess it. In the greater part of the provinces of France, there are, indeed (though, from their declension in the present disorder of government, it cannot be expected, perhaps, that there should be in them any considerable change), certain legal distinctions, which are not altogether so arbitrary. In some of the richest, most fertile, and best inhabited provinces in France, the succession of the great estates, though subject both to a right and a trust of probate (the right, by the statute in force in the kingdom of Spain; the trust, by the ancient feudal tenures), yet is, by the greater part of them, not subject to any such restriction. The son succeeds to all, and is heir both to his father's lands and his grandfather's revenues; but not necessarily to either of the two preceding, or to either of them in their entirety. In such provinces as are supposed likely to become very rich indeed, such as the greater part, or even the greater part of the counties in England; the succession, in this manner at least, being much more nearly upon an equal footing, and, consequently, much less subject to any considerable restriction. In

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 80

Scotland, indeed (for it is everywhere more extensive than England) it was a long time before it was possible to carry on the manufactures of Scotland without the intervention either of the English or French fleets. But though this intervention has not been altogether extirpation; yet, in proportion to its continuance, the number of those who have been able and willing to come to the aid of the mother country has increased much more slowly than in that of England. The number of those who are willing to go to war has, too, increased much more slowly in Scotland than in England; and though the number who are able and able to go to war has, upon all ordinary occasions, been very much augmented in both countries since the Union of 1609,[30] the proportion of those able who actually do go, has increased much less in the former, and considerably more in that in the other.

The money-price of the rude produce of the land has, in all these different instances, risen much faster than the real value of those commodities. In England it rose much more rapidly than it did in Holland. The Dutch were then, perhaps (though I cannot say for certain), somewhat less advanced in industry than they are now; the number of people employed in agriculture being, perhaps (although, I apprehend, somewhat exaggerated) much less in proportion to that employed at present. The price of the rude produce, however (the real value, or the money price), of the same sort, which the Scotch produce has in the present century risen so considerably above its former price in proportion to its real quality and quantity (that is, in the same proportion to its quantity as that of English commodities has fallen since the late war), that is, in their actual state, to the value of what is equivalent to their value, has risen very considerably more rapidly in Scotland than in England. The price of butcher's meat, indeed (for the same reason that it was in the present times a good deal dearer than it was in the time preceding 1648, or in that preceding the discovery of the mines of America) the real price of butcher's meat in both countries, is not so nearly regulated by the real quantity of butchering which can be done at home, as the real quantity which it is possible to purchase in foreign countries. In England, therefore, the quantity imported is always much less than it would be in a country where the real quantity of the same sort of goods could

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 81

always be sent for foreign sale. In the greater part of the inland trade, therefore, there is always a considerable quantity imported, and a much smaller quantity exported, but no great difference between the import and export quantities.

But the value of silver in England, though sunk by the reduction of its nominal price, has not, perhaps (for the present state of that value is unknown to us) been entirely destroyed by it; because the quantity exported is still very great; and the quantity of the precious metals imported is much more moderate, and seldom approaches near to the enormous exportation of corn.

It was in this manner that in the end of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth centuries, when the quantity of gold and silver money in the European markets had risen to its highest height, and the real value of those metals had sunk to its lowest, the value of silver was still maintained in some degree of scarcity, or at least of moderate plenty. It is in proportion to this scarcity or plenty, accordingly, only, that their real price can rise or fall. The value of those precious stones, however, as they are the materials from which the most valuable productions of land are manufactured, is necessarily in some degree regulated, in the same manner, by this scarcity or plenty; and the rise in their real value must be just equal to the rise in their nominal price. But the real value, both of gold, silver, and other metals, is in proportion to their quantity, and to what can either be spared or purchased without any such saving or purchase.

In consequence, too, of the declensions in Europe, of the decline and fall in the value both of gold and silver, of the increase of rude produce, and consequently of the quantity of labour necessary for preparing those materials for immediate use; of all those events which happened between 1350 and 1600, the value of those precious stones sunk to its lowest point. They became then the materials of coin; and as their real value was in this situation only, so much less than their nominal one, the value of the whole currency of every nation was reduced by the same quantity. The value of silver, however, as well, was not entirely destroyed by this declension in the value both either of the materials for its manufacture or of the currency of all nations; for though, by the declensions in Spain and Portugal, the real value of those metals sunk to a much lower degree than it

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 82

otherwise might have done, yet the nominal value did not so necessarily fall with it.

In order to restore the real value of silver to what had been before it had been degraded in any of the three ways above described, two different expedient were adopted; first, by the government of Chili and Peru, the mint was prohibited to produce any coin of less than twenty-five reals; and secondly, by the governments of the Brazillians and Potosi, it was permitted to make as good a penny as it could with twenty reales of the best gold and silver. In the course of a century, these two different methods of raising the nominal value of silver may be said to have restored the real value to it, and consequently to have rendered it equal, or very nearly equal, both in quantity and value, to the gold and silvers of old; and though, at first sight of things (for I shall now proceed to explain what is meant by the two first expedients above mentioned), it appears evidently that the value of the precious metals was never so high in any part of the known world as in the greater part of Europe during those turbulent and barbarous ages, yet the nominal sum of the world's annual production seems not then to have been very unequably divided between so great an abundance of different sorts of goods as at present.
The value, too, of the silver of Chili and Perú seems, in these times, to be no higher, perhaps, than in those ancient times; but it seems certainly much more equal than it was then, when the whole quantity annually produced amounted only to a third part of that which is produced in a century or two; or when, from so very small an increase of the annual production, a great and rapid declension of its nominal value could have taken place, and scarce been felt at all. In these times, the annual quantity of the precious metal annually produced, according to the best accounts, does not exceed one hundred thousand tons; and, according 


 

The quantity of gold annually circulated, according to the same accounts, is, it seems to me (and I am bound, however, to be very much mistaken), much greater than one million. The whole value, therefore, which the whole annual produce of those two countries could purchase, could not, in the course either of those two centuries, have equitably been divided between such a number, and scarce ever would have

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 83

equalled, much less exceeded, the value which the one alone could purchase.
The value which, in those two different periods, the one part of the produce of England, in the shape of corn, could purchase, could never have equalled the whole value, even in its present quantity and bulk, which that part of it can purchase in the present times; because it would have been necessary to employ a great part of the surplus corn of the other country. But it is not the whole surplus corn, but the proportionable portion, which is destined for the consumption of human persons, that is principally employed in producing food for those persons, or in satisfying their occasional wants. The whole quantity which the rude produce, or what is over-peppaged, could purchase, would have had to be distributed among many more people than it actually was. It is the portion, accordingly which, in the course either of the two periods, has been most carefully reserved for the immediate use and consumption of the labourers.

The value, however (continuing our example), which, in the course of the two periods, could properly be said to have been purchased by the annual produce, would have been precisely equal to the value, both at present and in former times, of what is commonly called the coarse corn produce of the two countries. It might have equaled likewise, or very nearly to it, what is commonly called the refined corn produce. The value, therefore, which the whole annual corn produce, or the coarse corn only, could have purchased in the present times, must necessarily have equalled the same value which the whole annual produce could purchase, or the fine corn produce, in the two preceding periods, and must, consequently, have equalled, or very nearly to it.


The bounty, therefore, in augmenting the quantity, must have been productive, first, of an increase, both of the quantity and value of corn, in consequence, probably, both, both of an additional quantity being brought to the market; and, secondly, of an increase of some other sort of produce, of which the quantity was either augmented, or, what comes nearly about the same, diminished, in consequence of the bounty; such as wool, hides, poultry, game of all kinds, &amps.; &amp.;c. In both cases, the value which, in the present state of tillage, could properly have replaced the capital which employed this produce in

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 84

maintaining this labour must, in the present state of cultivation, and even in the present state of tillage, be altogether wanting. The value which could replace this capital, in the same state in both of them in, must, in the one case a little more, in the other a little less; in the one a little more, in the second, somewhat less. The quantity of productive labourers, which, in the one state of cultivation, could be annually employed, must be equal, or nearly equally great in both; in the one, however, being much greater; and in the other much less. The quantity of unproductive, or productive labourers only, therefore, which can annually replace, in this manner, that capital, must be much smaller in either of them. The whole value which could be paid to the owner of this capital, must, in the one case, be equal, or nearly equally great in both, and, consequently the whole value of that labour which could be annually maintained by this capital, in the other, must be much less in either of them.

In both these states, therefore, the whole value, the whole annual revenue, must be withdrawn from that capital which maintains the productive labour of the society; in the present one, from the rent of the landlord and farmer, and, in that which is to follow, from the profits of stock employed as farmers or farmers' landlords.
The money price of labour, therefore, in the present, and, I think it is evident enough, in every other state of improvement, sinks gradually with the money price of corn, or with the real value of what it replaces. In every subsequent state of improvement it is likely to continue so, till it has got to the lowest rate at least which it can well fall. It seems, indeed, at this very day, to be somewhat lower than it was in the beginning 






  The money price of corn, or, in other words the real value of the annual produce, is, it is evident enough, naturally higher in a richer country than in one poorer. It is higher even in a rich than in a poor one. The real value, it must be observed, though it is not altogether so, does bear, in every country, a very close resemblance, both in quantity and value to that of the gross produce of land; and, therefore to that of all those

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 85

expensive and superfluities which the rude state of the country naturally affording, but which, by the improvement of arts and manufactures, are gradually becoming less and less. In the progress of refinement, the value, too, both of the gross and of that of the finer productions, diminishes in a much greater proportion, both of the one sort and of the other, than either their bulk or weight. The quantity and weight of the finer sorts of rude produce gradually diminish, till at last the gross quantity becomes almost as small as their weight; and in the progress of refinement to a still more refined and superior degree, the value diminishes still further. In a barbarous country where agriculture is in the highest vigor, a great deal may be said to be paid for what the husbandmen consider as the most useless and perishable part 







 The value of gold and of the precious metals, it is evident, is in proportion both more or smaller, in proportion both more, or, what is nearly the same thing in the same manner, less, to what the rude and manufactured productions commonly pay in every country.

It is in this manner that the value, both of the gross and of the fine produce of the land, gradually increases with improvement. It seems to do so everywhere in the most perfect manner; in every country, however; and in every country in proportion to its extent, to what it can maintain the greatest number of people, or, what is the same thing, the least number of idle, poor people, who can either work upon it themselves, or purchase of other people what they can work up of their own. In the most perfect and extensive country in which agriculture has ever been introduced and cultivated, there would, no doubt, always be some inequality, either in quantity, or in value, of either of those two different productions, which would be the necessary effects of such a great extension of the rude produce. But in a small and confined country, in one which is constantly surrounded by more improved and more populous countries, the inequality would, no more than in the greater and more extensive countries, occasion a much more tragical and alarming disorder than what is to be found in almost any other. The inhabitants of a country so circumstanced would soon learn, by experience, what the most perfectly extended and improved countries are always careful never to teach their subjects, that the value of a rude production cannot be augmented but in a

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 86

much greater proportion than that of its refined produce. They might then easily distinguish, from a mere curiosity, what were the true advantages of a more extended commerce; what, perhaps, was really the principal advantage of it, or which of those two different productions, the rude or manufactured one, really enhanced, in the quantity and quality, the other. The inhabitants, too, of such countries, might learn, too (and they have already begun to learn this), what were the principal causes and effects of the great increase, not of their own, but of the riches, industry, and population of other nations, which, by means of a more extended commerce and intercourse, had been brought into competition with them; and they might, too, easily judge, how far those causes, and those effects, could contribute either, either to increase or diminish their own wealth, their industry, and population, in the same manner as those of other countries, had they been left to themselves.


 CHAP. IV.

OF A MARKETPLACEMENT FOR GOODS, AS INFLUENTIAL AS PRODUCING THE PRINCIPAL PARTICULAR PRODUCT OF A COMMERCE OR INDUSTRIOUS COUNTRIES.  The market for a good is necessarily limited; and it cannot be very large, if the goods which supply that demand are produced at a distance. If the demand arises principally, or even principally from the consumption of distant places; if the commodities which supply that demand are manufactured at a distance from the market from which the consumers are drawn; the market will naturally be very large indeed. If the commodities, however, which are the immediate objects of the demand of distant buyers and buyers, are all manufactured at the particular place from which the buyers carry their purchases, there is no necessity of a market for those commodities; for they will be all sold in the home-market. If, on the other side, the goods, of which the supply is chiefly or even principally derived from the distant manufacture, happen to be those of a peculiarly valuable nature, such as those of precious metals, the market will naturally be very small.

A particular commodity, it is evident, cannot always find the best market at every particular place, where its quality is either peculiarly or generally valued, or where it is produced; because the goods, of which it supplies that demand are necessarily purchased at the expense of something else, either of the same kind

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 87

, or of something else more valuable. If the quantity imported were great enough, the goods could never be sold in their native country, and might be exported again, with a profit, without occasioning any loss to either party. The quantity imported, therefore, must, for some time, be somewhat less than the quantity exported.

The annual importation of gold and silvers, it has already been observed, amounts to upwards, it is said, more threepence in twenty than the whole annual consumption of those metals in Great Britain. The whole annual importation, therefore (according to the most accurate account we can form of it), is about L.1,200,000 : 8s.; and that part of this which comes annually to Great Britain (according to what is commonly reckoned the lowest estimation) is, perhaps, not much greater. The whole annual consumption of those metals, however, in the whole kingdom of Great Britain, may, it is probable, be very nearly upon a level, and may, perhaps, be somewhat greater than L.2,000. The annual importations of those metals, therefore, must be, the one a good deal more, the others a good deal less above what they actually are, than the annual consumption of those commodities in the whole kingdom. The whole annual consumption, however, is probably much greater in proportion than the whole annual importation, and the whole importation is probably a good deal more above what it actually is. The gold which, in times past (I believe, I may be allowed a conjecture) has come to this kingdom in any considerable measure for foreign sale, was probably, not so much for home sale, as to purchase a cargo of goods for some foreign market. But if it has ever been the intention of the merchants who brought that gold into England, either to employ it themselves as an additional stock to employ in the home trade, or to exchange it again for a cargo of home produce, the annual importations must, the one may reasonably believe (though not without some reason), have exceeded the whole consumption in the whole kingdom.

It has been observed, too (p. 88), that in China and Indochina, gold, and not silver, constitutes the principal article carried by sea to the countries to which those metals belong. The real value of silver is, there as everywhere, much greater than the nominal, and the quantity imported is not only but somewhat less, but

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 88

the real importation being always less in proportion to the quantity exported, the nominal value of silver, though not diminished in any respect, is certainly diminished a good deal.

The annual importations of foreign corn into Spain amount at present, I have heard it asserted, to more than 150,000 tons; of this number, perhaps half, and perhaps no more than one-fifth, are destined, it is said, for our own consumption; the other four-fifths are sent abroad again, either for the supply, or consumption of other nations, and never return home again. The annual exports of corn into Spain, therefore (I have no precise information concerning this), must be more, perhaps less, than 100-200,00, the surplus, perhaps more than 300,000 tons. If, in consequence of the declension of agriculture, the real value of silver in Spain should fall from about L.3,000 an ox. down to about L.,400 an ox., the annual imports into the country would be less, and consequently the real importations into the neighbourhood of Lisbon would be less than before; and if it should rise to about L.,900 an ox., the annual exports would be greater and would bring more silver into the neighbourhood. But as the real importations into Portugal, besides, being much less in proportion than those of any other European nation to that of Spain and France, would be much more likely, in consequence of the diminuition of those metals, both the annual imports into Portugal, and their subsequent reexportation into all other countries, to fall short of the annual exports of the former country; the real importations into Spain would probably increase a little in consequence, but would not increase very greatly in comparison of the annual exports of Portugal.

The annual importation of foreign corn is, upon this account, supposed to have no tendency to diminish in Spain, though the nominal value may. In the year which ended on the 5th of January, 1636, the gross produce of Spanish agriculture amounted to 6,743,542 : 10 : 9; the neat produce of its inland, and that of the coasting trade, to 3333,333 : 8 : 9; and the neat importation of foreign corn was supposed to amount to 17,821,927 : 11: 9. In the year which began on the 5th of July, 1736, the same gross produce of Spanish agriculture

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 89

was estimated at L.3,843 : 8 : 9¼, which was reckoned the highest estimation which had ever been given to that produce. This high estimate, though not made with any very exact criterion, is supported by the evidence of the public revenue, and may, perhaps, without being too precise, be considered as a sufficient warrant of its being true.
The annual produce, therefore, of Spanish agriculture before 1736, was L.4,742,333&#8260&#8360&#8560;12d., which is about ten millions sterling. The gross revenue, however, arising out of it in that particular year was only L1,527,848 : 10s.; and though this was a good many thousand pounds more than had usually passed in trade before, the real value of the annual consumption of that consumption, which must have taken up some part of it (and probably the whole), was probably much less.

In 1736, when this high estimation was first established, there had been two different prices of the greater part, or, what comes to the like quantity of silver, of all Spanish produce. One of these prices was at Buenos Ayres, the capital of the empire; and the other, the average price of all the provinces, or what is nearly the like quantity of all the different sorts and qualities, was at Lima. These two prices are here compared.
The average price, or what is the mean of the whole, of all the various sorts of Spanish corn, is here computed at L.2,945, or eight-and -twenty shillings and sixpence an acre, according to the best information which can now, I believe, be had.

That part of his rent which is paid by tenants upon corn lands is commonly called the corn-rent, or, what is the same thing, the seed-rent, because, in consequence either either of the improved fertility of the land itself or of the improved cultivation which is brought about by means of it, the whole value of the seed is frequently greater than the whole value of the rent. The rent, therefore, of corn lands, is commonly said to be in proportion to their seed.

In 1739, the average rent was at Lima 3¼d. the quintal.

The value, both of the annual consumption, in proportion to its gross revenue and in

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 90

proportion to the neat revenue of its capital, is necessarily inversely regulated, as the rent and profit are inversely regulated, by their proximity to the annual produce.
The value, both of the neat revenue of its annual produce and of its annual rent, must necessarily be greater, or less (according to different circumstances), than what it is at present at the rate at which they are commonly paid in gold and silver, in proportion to what they commonly are at in corn and pasture; and the quantity, either of the one or of both, is necessarily inversely regulated by that rate. The value, either of its annual produce or of its annual rent, may rise in consequence of several different accidents. The landlord may get richer, and the farmer may get poorer, before either can expect the full value of what is due to them from the land. In a country where there is no foreign trade, where the only market for all that is produced within the country, is the home consumption; the value, either of the annual produce or of the annual rent, will always rise with the prosperity of that home consumption, and fall with the declension and depression of its prosperity; or, in other words, with the increase and diminution of that demand for those commodities which is immediately derived from the increase or declensions of the national industry.
The price which, in the actual state of tillages and improvements in any country, arises from this difference in their relative values, may be called the profit of improvement, and is everywhere regulated by this rate, according to which, in the actual condition of tillages and improvements, the rent of a landed property, in proportion to the value which it affords of the whole rude material of its produce, must be most nearly equal to the neat rent. It may, however (for it is a matter not very easy to ascertain) arise from a different cause from that of the neat profit.
The price which, in the actual state either of tillage or improvement, arises from a like difference in their relative prices, is, I believe, commonly understood to consist in the difference, first in their being paid in corn, and, secondly, in the quantity of that commodity, which must be paid for each bushel, or half bushel of corn, or for each barrel, or pecks of oats, in proportion to their weight or measure, or to the quantity of labour which it requires to raise and collect them.
In

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 91

proportion to its quantity, therefore, corn is more liable than any other sort of rude material, to variations in the demand for it.

It must be observed, too, that the value of silver has been gradually declining in all the different parts either  of Europe. The same causes which have given it a considerable value in Spain and Portugal, are likely to give some value there still to the greater portion either  of the produce of the lands of Italy, of which the fertility seems, at present, not very great.
The same cause has probably given some value to some small part of the rude produce of North and West America. In all the countries where corn has been longest stationary, the value of silver, it has already been observed, seems to have been gradually diminishing; and it seems likely to do so, too, in all those in which it is least stationary. In the progress of improvement and population the value of the greater portion must rise, and that of the smaller diminish.

In the course both of ancient and modern history, the value of silver has been constantly diminishing. It seems not improbable, however, that the value of corn may sometimes rise somewhat during these periods. In ancient times it must frequently have been so, as the greater part, or at most a very great part, either 

¾ ¾

The price of rude produce, though it varies according to the different prices at which it is brought to market; varies most exactly with that which takes place between the farmer, and the merchant who purchases his crop for him. The farmer is, in this case, the sole consumer, and his price regulates, in every particular market of the world, that of every particular commodity.
The price, therefore of every commodity must, in every particular market of Europe, be most nearly regulated by that at which it commonly costs, or is likely to cost, the greatest quantities either of labour or of other goods, the real price of labour being the only variable which can occasion a sensible difference. But though the real price, or the quantity which it is likely to cost, should be greatest in the neighbourhood of the great town, or the country village, it would not, in the long-run, be likely to be greatest there, even in those remote parts of the world where agriculture is most neglected; in North America or China. There, the real price of labour is not much above that of Scotland; and in

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 92

some parts even of that kingdom, the labour of the poor, though much inferior in strength, dexterity, and cleanliness to that which is employed at present in the most fashionable trades, yet, in the same degree of poverty, produces a much greater produce.

The real recompence of industry is, like that of other human enjoyments and employments, regulated by the demand; and it varies with that demand as it varies likewise with all the variations in the state of wealth and industry in the society, and with the increase and diminuation of those two different sets of riches.

The value of the precious metals, therefore (for the same reason that the price of labour is much lower among barbarians than in advanced nations, and the real recompence of labour is much greater), must have been much higher, and their quantity more considerable in the rude beginnings of the society, than it is in the present times, or in countries where there is a tolerable security, both of private property and of public justice. It is in countries where those two things have generally been most completely established; in countries, accordingly, which are, or at any rate ought to become more civilized and improved, the most populous and the most improved countries of Europe. In those more improved countries, therefore, we shall naturally expect, not to see much scarcity of the precious metals; and we may safely depend upon their increasing in their natural abundance.


 CHAP II.

HOW THE PRICES OF SILK AND OF OAKEN PLANT LIFE ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE CALCULATIONS IN THE PRICE OR WAGE SYSTEMS. The Variations of these Prices in Different Ages, and in Different Countries. The Variations, too in Different Times.


 The prices, accordingly, of the two most essential articles of clothing in ancient times, of the silk of Gengis Khan and of that of Asdrubal (which, in the course of the fourteenth century was probably introduced into Spain from Flanders, by means of the Normans), are said to be nearly in the same proportion as their relative values, or, more properly speaking, as the money-price of the one and that part only of clothing, of which those prices were sufficient. The money-price of silk was about three-and-forty shilling a pound; and that of coarse linen about two shillINGS and sixpence halfpenny. These

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 93

, however, though very considerable in proportion to the whole quantity, are, in reality very insignificant in comparison of the great surplus of corn which is annually exported from the kingdom, of the value which it brings into the coffers of foreign countries. The greater the number of those obstructing the natural progress of agriculture, the more difficult it will always be for a nation, even under the most favourable circumstances to find out a method by which it may continue its natural course, or, what comes to nearly the same, its unimpaired one, towards improvement. In every civilized society, the wealth of the great body of the people, the annual produce of their land and labour employed in maintaining productive labourers, naturally tends to increase in an inverse ratio to their advancing riches; that is to say, to increase as the stock and revenue which support this stock, and this revenue in turn support that stock, grow more extensive and extensive.
The wealth, however, which the inhabitants of Scotland enjoy at present, is, perhaps, not much greater than what they had enjoyed in the beginning of the last century. The increase, too, in their stock and in the revenue which they have occasion for (the stock, indeed, is not supposed to be greater, but it has increased greatly in proportion to the whole capital which supported and directed it before), is much more gradual. In 1695 and 1696, according  To these facts it may perhaps, without any absurdity be compared, with what the greater part of the inhabitants in other countries enjoy, or were supposed to enjoy, at present.

In a civilized state, the produce, either of domestic industry, of agriculture in general, of manufactures, or of the trade which carries the produce of all those different employments from one place to another, is necessarily confined within narrow bounds, and cannot extend beyond them. But the surplus produce of the rude productions of the earth, which is over and above what is necessary for maintaining the labourers and artifices which compose that produce, can, if left free to wander about from one employment to another, carry with it a very considerable profit. The rent which the landlord derives, not only for this considerable surplus produce, but for the labour which he puts into preparing and bringing it to market, is the principal fund which maintains and directs all other employment. The rent of land, and consequently of houses, and all the improvements which they afford, constitute, as they always have, the principal and

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 94

most essential parts either of revenue or of expense in a great empire.

The price of venison, therefore, in the different states of Europe, must have varied with this variation of the price both of land and in the rent which it commanded there. The variations have generally been greater in the northern than either in the south, or even in the more inland part of any one of those different countries.
In France and England, indeed the price of venison has fallen considerably since it first rose in the twentieth and thirteenth centuries. In the course, however, of these two centuries the real rent of all the estates which are supposed at present to be under cultivation, including not only that of France and Great Britain, but that of all the other countries in North America and the West, has risen considerably, so that in those days it might have been expected that the real value of the commoner's portion of land would be somewhat lower, not only in the northern, but, what would probably have been the case, even in the more inland provinces of North American and Western America; because in those times, when the rents of all the estates of cultivation were at their highest, the commoner was likely to have had his portion allotted for him in a much more ample manner than in those times when they are least sufficient. The real price, therefore, must have been higher in those times than in the times immediately preceding them, when, by a better management, the lands were in the greatest disorder, when the most fertile and best cultivated could be purchased with a very small part of the original purchase money. In those latter times the real price, however, has, notwithstanding, fallen considerably; because in some provinces the landlord is said not to be obliged to give the deer a market, and, in others not even to keep him in the park, where he is at present so common in Scotland, but to let him wander in the neighbourhood, in such numbers, and under such regulations, as may render his food and exercise more than sufficient for himself, his number increasing every day, and his habitation, though not very large and comfortable, yet sufficiently commodified.

It has been the object, too, of many writers to show, how much the real price of venison varies in the different parts of Europe. It varies, says Mr Hume, from twenty to forty per cent. in the most thriving, in those which have the best pasture,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 95

are always most abundant, and are the most plentiful in proportion to the quantity of corn consumed. The produce of uncultivation, therefore, is always most plentiful, and is the most abundant in proportion as that produce increases the least. In countries which, from the want of pasture and good roads, are not very rich, poultry, and game of all kinds, make but a part of their general subsistence; and in those which abound greatly, the whole expense is defrayed, not by poultry only, but with a considerable part of wild game. In France, for example (which, I am assured, is one of those countries in Europe which are not rich in poultry, but which, from want of good pasture, are very poor in game of all kinds), it costs the farmer, says Doctor Burn, L'Agriculture, par excellance, to feed one hen for a-week; whereas it costs him L'Etat, to feed ten. In the one country, accordingly, he must content himself, not with one, but with twenty or thirty chickens, which, in the other, he can maintain only with a part, perhaps, of his ordinary profit. In the former situation, therefore (for I do believe it is true of all countries where there are neither manufactures nor commerce), poultry are a much less important part of their subsistence than in the other. The same thing may, perhaps, be said of some other countries. In Holland and Flanders, for instance (where, I am assured, the poultry trade is carried on with more fidelity than anywhere else in Europe, though not so strictly), butcher-meat makes but a part, perhaps of the common subsistence, of the common people. In France and Italy, indeed, where, by the negligence of husbandry, the greater part, I apprehend (for I do not pretend to warrant it), is lost in the poultry trade; yet in those countries the poultry is the principal, and the whole expense defrayed, either with a considerable part, or altogether with the greater part, by the wild venison, or by some sort or venison which the farmers have occasion for; and in those countries, too, the greater part, I am assured (for I have not the least suspicion), of those who are able to pay any considerable rent for this part of their food, are not capable of supporting the whole expense of their table, without employing either some poultry-keeper or

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 96

butcher.

The land, too (and in all cases where the landlord is the landlord, the landlord is the landlord, and must necessarily be the greatest proprietor in the country), must be fit for raising corn, for feeding the poultry; for, if it was not, the whole expense would be defrayed by the corn, and not by the landlord. It is otherwise in countries where there is no landlord. The whole farm is capable of supporting itself, and the landlord is not obliged to feed the poultry, because they themselves will feed the cattle. The cattle, therefore (and the greater part, I believe, of them), are not fed altogether with corn, but in some measure with wild venison. In such a situation of things, the whole expense of the landlord is defrayed altogether, either by the corn or by the wild venison; and the whole produce is consumed either immediately by the people at home, or by those travelling to or from them.

The attention of husbandmen is, no doubt, very different from that of landlords; and it seems not unreasonable to suppose, that in the one situation of things they have less skill and ingenuity; in the second more; and, in proportion as they have both more and less of either of those qualities, the one or other must naturally prevail in the end. The attention of landlords is, in this respect, evidently superior, though less skilful and ingenious, than that of farmers. Farmers have been known (I have heard it asserted even in France) to employ a whole night, and sometimes the whole day, to collect a particular species of grass or of wild-catchers; and, after a very long and tedious labour of that sort, to find in it an ounce of gold. This is done, not only for amusement, but to make up a certain deficiency in their own stock, in case they should have any occasion to employ that of their neighbours. Farmers, on the contrary (though they have been known, I am well assured, sometimes in the same manner), when their stock is very small, and their situation not so advantageous; but, on account of their superior attention and ingenuity in the direction in which they are employed, have frequently occasion to employ their whole lives in the search of gold dust.

The attention of the landlords, on the contrary, though it is not necessarily superior to the attention of farmers; is in this respect, perhaps, equally incapable

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 97

. They are always more or less occupied in cultivating their lands, in maintaining their herds and flock, their poultry and other cattle. The attention of the landlord, however, when he has once made this discovery of some advantage in the price of wool or raw hides from his tenant's sheep or oxen, naturally leads him to employ that attention, with all the industry, skill, and knowledge which it requires, upon a much greater variety of occasions; and to find some way, besides, by which he can either reduce this price below what he could have got for it, by raising the rent; or raise it higher, and thereby enable himself to pay a better rent, than what he could have got for it, if it had been sold in the market, without any such discovery. He naturally endeavours to do both at once.

It is not so much from a view to raise the real rent of land, by rendering the rent of a certain quantity, whatever it might be supposed, greater than it otherwise would have been; as it generally is from an intention of selling at this price, what is called a bad lease, or, what comes nearly to a like notion, a bad price, for a greater quantity. The farmer is always willing to sell a good rent for the bad rent which he gets from the land, and the landlord, for the good price he pays for the bad price he gets for a greater number.


In England, the average price of a fattened steer is about twenty shillings, which may be compared to about ten shilling sterling a-head, the price commonly received by farmers for good English cattle; or in the same manner, to the price at present received by artificors, we may believe, for good French horses. But the average price of the fleece is not supposed to be more than five shillings and threepence a-piece; which, when compared with the average price of the carcase, will give you the idea how much less valuable it is. A pound of the best French fleece will purchase but a small quantity of good French beef. A pound, accordingly, of the best English will purchase but little more, or purchase but one-fourth of the number. If the fleece was dear and dearder, as it frequently is, the price would be still less than it really amounts 


The price, too, of a good old English cow or bull

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 98

ock, when first brought to market in the spring or summer, is not necessarily the same as that which it actually sells for in the autumn, when it has had time to grow fat and tender; and it may sometimes happen that, before she is brought to market in the fall, she weighs but twenty stone, or about six-tenths part less than when she first comes to market. The same cause may occasion a like difference in her sale price at different seasons, even when both the fleece and her weight are the same. In years when there is a great scarcity, the prices are often much higher; and sometimes in the course of a year, too, when both these things happen together. The scarcity, it must be remembered, is generally owing to the badness or bad management of husbandry. The good condition of some of the best pastured lands, which is the cause either of the scarcity, or of its being relieved by the plenty of the seasons; the bad condition of others, arising from other accidents; such as the drought which happened in the end of the last winter, and which was probably owing to the negligence of the government; such causes frequently occasion extraordinary high prices. In years of plenty, therefore the high price is commonly owing, not so much to the goodness of the pasture, but rather, to its badness. The same thing may be said, I believe, of many of the best pastured lands of France. The high prices paid in those parts of Europe are commonly due to the bad condition of some particular lands, owing partly 





To what causes, or to the badness of husbandry, are high or cheap prices commonly due? I shall consider each separately, without taking much farther notice of the common effects which naturally take place in every particular market. First, I shall consider the natural causes which, in all countries, occasion a high or low market price. Secondly (and in the third and last place, I shall consider the unnatural), the causes which, in the same country, occasion a high or cheap price either of cattle altogether or of some sorts of cattle, but not of all, but of a particular kind or species. Thirdly (and in the fourth and fifth place, I shall consider those unnatural causes), those which occasion a high price of cattle, but not of all sorts of cattle, of a particular kind or species. Fourthly, of the high prices paid for cattle

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 99

and other provisions, during those turbulent and disorderly times; a period, indeed, very unlike the peaceable, steady, and uninterrupted prosperity which precedes the great revolutions of commerce and government, in any country. The high price which the English farmers pay, not for the produce of their own land, but for the produce either of the Irish or of the plantations, may satisfy us, how far the natural course of things may have been altered, even in this respect; though, from a different cause, it must have affected them still more unequally. The low prices of corn during the two centuries preceding the late war in America, are not the effect of any diminuation in its real value, or of any change of the laws which regulate its importation and exaltation, but are owing, partly to the scarcity occasioned, partly to the increase of the produce of the British and Irish plantations, during those same two centuries; and partly, perhaps to a greater scarcity, arising altogether from some other cause. It is owing, however, chiefly to the latter.

The price of corn has, in the present and former century of our prosperity, been gradually declining, not only in England, but through most of Europe. The French have not yet recovered the old rate of sixs and seven-and thirties shillings a-peck. In the last war in 1756 and 1763, it was in England only four-and twenty shilling quarters, and in France, five and twenty shillings. In consequence of these different events in Europe, it seems not unreasonable that the price, at least of some parts of Europe, should be said, during those two centuries, either to have fallen somewhat, or not to have risen much; that it should, in particular, have fallen somewhat towards the end, when, by the discovery and colonization of America and the West Indies, the demand of Europe for corn was so much increased; or that, at the beginning of these two periods, the price of some sorts of corn might not be supposed to have been higher in England than it had been about the middle of the last century. The low prices of those turbulent and disorderly times seem, however (for they are always relative) not very different from those high prices. The real value of silver, which, during those turbulent and disorderly times was very low, has now become very much higher; and, in the greater portion of the British and Scotch estates

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 100

of all ranks and ages, the value of that metal is said to be greater now than it was at any time during the late war, and, perhaps than at any time before the late recoinage. The depreciation, therefore (and this is what I call its natural tendency) must have been so much more violent than that of the other metals, that, in proportion to their respective values, the value, not only 




 







 Part IV: Of the Expense of the Public Works and institutions of every kind which the People of Great Britain can annually maintain. The expense, either of repairing, maintaining or extending any of those public works or institutions, is evidently the smallest part of what they are annually charged with maintaining.

The whole expense, either, first, in time of peace, of maintaining a standing, or of preparing a ground for one; and, second, of erecting, improving, or extending, any of those buildings or works, which are erected for some public or religious purpose, such as a cathedral, public park, or market town, may be considered as the maintenance of a certain quantity of labour. The rent, too, of this labour may, no more, perhaps than the rent of any other sort of land be computed; and, as the whole expense is commonly defrayed from one single source of rent (the rent arising from the ground which is laid out for building), this sum may, no doubt, properly be regarded as one half or one third of that expense.
The whole expense, either of repairing, or in time either of erecting a public or religious building, or of preparing a new market town, may likewise, be regarded as one third or one half of what is annually maintained in the neighbourhood of the capital. The whole rent, however, of this third or one half, may, no doubt, properly, and exactly be regarded, as one fourth or one tenth of what is annually employed in those public or religious works. The expense of the maintenance of those buildings, or the preparation of a market town, may be regarded, no more than the other two, as the necessary consequence of a certain annual produce of the land and labor of the country, or, more accurately, of what is necessary for procuring that annual produce.
The maintenance either of a private person or of a small number of individuals may, no doubt, be properly and exactly comprehended under the general

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 101

term of expense; and it would be absurd, indeed (I am afraid that I am speaking too mildly), to pretend that the whole expense which any individual, company or country undertakers can lay upon their own workmen is not properly and exactly comprehended in that of that particular workmen. The whole expense, however, which any particular workmen, whether independent or employed by any private company or society, are under any obligation to contribute towards their own subsistence and their own necessary maintenance, is properly and exactly comprehended under this general term. It consists in what they can earn, in what they have occasion to earn; in the price which they must give for the use of their labour. It is this which constitutes both the wages of the labour and its profits; which makes the annual revenue which any particular person, or set of persons, possesses. It makes, too, what may be called its fixed capital, or the quantity and weight of the materials, tools, provisions and household furniture which must be kept in constant repair, in order that it may be employed in this way. The fixed capital, or the quantity of these, is the fund which, in all great nations, regulates both the wages of labour, the profits of trade and manufactures, and the exchangeable values of all those different sorts of goods.

It has already been observed, in treating of the variations in wages and profits during different ages, and in different countries, that, in all those different periods and countries, a certain proportion, a certain proportion, was always maintained in each, according to the fixed capital which had been employed in producing the goods, and the wages and profit of those who had been engaged in producing them. The same fixed capital employed in the production of rude and manufactured produce produces a much greater surplus value than that employed in the production of the more delicate and ornamental productions. A certain proportion must, in all cases, be maintained, according to the fixed capital employed in producing those more expensive commodities. In the progress from coarse to fine produce, the value which must replace this fixed capital must necessarily rise in the progress, and must at least double in the progress, of every rise of price. In the progress from the coarse produce to the more delicate, and in that to the more ornamental produce, the proportion which must always maintain this proportion must rise much faster than it does at first.

The proportion which always maintains this proportion is the proportion which, either in time,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 102

place, or persons, always maintains it. It is this proportion only which can give any reasonable warrant that the price of any commodity, of which a certain proportion has once been fixed by law or usage for a long time together (for the same reason, I suppose, why the proportion between the wages and the profit of labour is always the most reasonable one, though, in ordinary cases, it varies more from one workman to the next), will continue to do so for ever, and, consequently that the value which that commodity really possesses, or was supposed to have, before the institution or usage of those laws, will continue to subsist. The proportion, too, between the quantity of silver which, in the actual state in which things were at the commencement of this statute, was commonly contained within a particular weight and measure, and which, after that state had changed, continued to subsist in the actual state in which they had been, is necessarily the most proper one, both to determine what is likely, at any given time, to have taken its rise in that state; and, consequently, to shewn what is likely to take its fall in any given time. The quantity, besides which, at any given time, is commonly contained within the same weight and measure with which it was commonly contained at that time, is necessarily regulated by several other circumstances; and these circumstances, though not, perhaps (though I am by no means certain) altogether so necessary, are certainly more sufficient, or, perhaps, even than the other three.
The proportion which always maintains that proportion must always maintain that which regulates it; or it cannot be altered without some very considerable alteration in that which regulates it. The proportion between the quantity of corn, which, in the real state which existed before the institution of those laws which gave the bounty, consisted of a certain quantity of each of the four principal parts of corn, viz. of the seed, the flour, the meal, and the oil; and which, after that institution, was commonly divided among different people into so many different parcels, as made up for a greater or smaller part, must have remained, whatever may be the variations which took their rise or fell in different periods, the same. That the quantity contained in any of those parcels was, in the real state of things, likely, at any particular time, either to increase or to diminish, according

The value of gold, therefore, in proportion to that of silver in every particular country, is regulated, it has already been observed, not so much by its intrinsic quality, as by the proportion which its annual consumption is supposed to take place either towards improvement, or to waste and extravagance. The value of silver in every particular country, therefore, may be very different from what is commonly represented to the public by what may commonly be called its nominal value; and it may even be very much lower than the representation may lead the public to expect.

In a civilized country, the quantity of industry annually employed in producing subsistence is regulated by two different circumstances; first by the demand of the society, and, second, and more indirectly, by its produce.

The society demands a certain quantity, it produces a certain quantity. If its produce is not equal, its demand must be greater or less, than what it produces; and, if greater than this, it will require a larger and a smaller quantity of productive labour to supply that increased consumption. If it is equal to what it produces (or, what comes to the same thing, if the same value of silver be paid for a certain quantity), its demand must necessarily be in proportion to its produce; or, in other words it must be equal to what is sufficient to replace the capital which has employed that produce in producing it, together with its ordinary profits. The quantity of industry annually employed, in producing a certain quantity of subsistence is regulated partly by its own demand, which is continually changing with all the variations of its own prosperity or declension; and, partly, too, by that of some other society. The quantity annually produced in the country where that annual produce consists, is regulated partly by its demand, and partly, too, by that of that country; and both those societies, though they may be very far from being perfectly equal in wealth and power, yet being equally advanced or retarded in their industry, are, perhaps, as near, or as far, as it is possible for any society, to be represented by the two different pieces of furniture in the illustration of the present chapter. In a civilized country, the annual produce, it is to be observed, may be either greater or less, according 

86




The quantity of industry annually employed, therefore, may, at different times, both be greater or

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 104

smaller, and may, at any one time, be either more, or less employed. But though, in the progress of improvement, this annual produce should, in every particular year, increase in a greater degree than before, it will always increase gradually; and the annual consumption, too, though it should increase in an equal degree, yet will increase more slowly, and will last longer, the one because the other, than it otherwise would have done, had the productive powers of the labour been more or less augmented in proportion as the annual produce increased. In every particular period after the fall of the Roman Empire, the value, both real and nominal, both of the precious metals, and of the greater portion of the rude produce, must necessarily be greater than at any former time. But this greater quantity of the precious metals could not have afforded a greater revenue to the public, nor a more extensive market for that greater quantity, had not the annual consumption increased more rapidly. The nominal value of all those different sorts of goods, too, which had formerly cost so dear, would have been still higher, and the quantity of their consumption greater still, had there been less annual increase of productive powers; and the same quantity, it may perhaps be said, might still, too have been bought with less labour, or with a less quantity, if there was less annual increase of the rude produce of land.

In a barbarous country where agriculture was little cultivated, stockings and stock must always, upon such a footing, have been very dear, as they are in a civilized country. They could not well afford the revenue of an individual, who had no fixed habitation, or who had not the means either to purchase or to cultivate his land. But in such a country as England, in which every individual, even though he had neither fixed habitations nor land to purchase or cultivate, has, in consequence of the improvement of arts and industry, a great deal more property to dispose either of, or to give away, than he ever had before, and in which every individual is enabled to acquire a greater share of the useful produce, than he ever could before; stockings and stock must everywhere have become cheaper than before, as well in the coarse and middling as the fine and elegant dress, as in the whole dress of every sort. In every part of the empire there has arisen in every particular place an alteration in the fashion of wearing stockings. They have come, it

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 105

seems, from all parts of Europe to make this manufacture. They are said to number upwards, not only of thousands but of millions. They are the woollen manufacturers, who manufacture their own materials, and, with a very small addition, make every thing else which is required for making the woollen cloths, either for foreign or domestic sale. The woollen manufacturers are the great undertaker, and maintain the greater part of those workmen who are employed in the preparation and making of those cloths; and those workmen, again, are maintained by other workmen, and the greater part by landlords. The rent, it has already been observed, is a real recompence, for labour which produces something which is useful, or even agreeable to the person to whose account the work is performed. The price of the complete work, however (which is generally purchased with a considerable part of the rent), is always higher than that for any particular part, or even of the materials, which are purchased with a part of that price. It must be paid, therefore (I have endeavoured to shew by what examples), in the one case, in the rent, in another in the price of those materials. In this respect, therefore the whole price of the manufacture must be paid, in the same manner, in the two prices of the materials. The whole value which, it seems, the whole society can annually derive from this produce of labour is equal to both those prices.

In the foregoing part of this chapter I have endeavoured, by a few very general and obvious observations upon this subject, to show that the whole annual produce of labour is, or ought, to be employed, first, in purchasing and maintaining productive labour 

¼


  PART III: OF THE PRODUCTIVE AND INCOMPARABLE LABOUR PRODUCES WHICH ARE PRODUCING THE COMMODITIES TO WHICH IT CAN ALMOST BE CONTRARY


The other three parts, of the price of the rude produce, or the three parts which compose it which can almost be almost always exchanged in its own right, I have endeavoured to show are altogether different, though inseparable, parts of that price. They are, therefore, as necessary parts of the whole price of that rude produce, as those parts of it which are necessary for purchasing and maintaining the productive labourers, or for preparing it for the use and consumption of men, and

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 106

for constituting, together with it the whole rent, profit, wages, and profit, of the land.
The profits of stock are everywhere regulated by three different circumstances. The one may be considered as a sort of fixed, the other as circulating capital, and the third as variable. The fixed capitals, or what are properly called productive powers of land, are always the same. They are, however; in different circumstances; either more or less productive. In the improvement and cultivation of lands, a great part of the stock of the farmer belongs to himself, and he can employ no other. The stock of the manufacturer is generally lent to his workmen, who employ it themselves in the improvement and cultivation of land. But though this capital, therefore, belongs always, or very nearly always, to the same proprietor as that of the farmer, the nature of the employment renders it of very little importance to that owner; because, as he is himself always the greatest consumer, so he is likewise always the greatest producer of the goods upon which it is employed. His interest, however, is interested to see that the workmen should have as great an interest to work as he himself does; and the interest of the manufacturer is the same, though somewhat less directly. Both are interested, therefore, not only that their work shall be of such a nature as to yield a certain profit, but that the profit shall likewise afford a revenue, sufficient for maintaining and employing the same quantity of productive labour in the maintenance of their respective productive powers.

In countries which are advancing in the improvement and cultivation of their land; and where the stock of those proprietor and manufacturers who live upon the profits of their own work are much greater, than in countries still in its infancy; the interest which these two different sets 




Page headings : Stock, the profits of stock naturally low where the stock is most abundant, and high where it is most scantily supplied]

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, PG 113

The interest which both these two sets of proprietor-manufacturers have in their different stocks, may, no doubt, be regarded as altogether distinct from the interest which the landlords have in their respective parcels of land. But the interest of the latter, as well as of the former, must evidently have something to recommend it to the landlord; or it would be altogether incapable either

IT FROM LANDLORD'S EMPLOYMENTS, PG 109


Lemuel, the famous judge of Burgoyne, when he gave judgment concerning a disputed boundary between two tenants of the king's land, observed with much proprience that the interest and character of each of them must have something in its favour, or else it could have no right to dispute.

In all the different trades which are carried on in cities or country villages by private adventurers, it seems to be universally allowed, that their interest as landlords is, in every respect equal to that even of a private man. The difference is, that they do not have any exclusive privilege of trading in the places where their stock and reputation are greatest, but are obliged, in the like manner, to sell at what is reasonable for their goods. The same equality of consideration, however, must, no

The same equality of consideration must, no doubt, take place in all the different parts of a great kingdom; and the same inequality in favour either side, might produce very unequal fortunes. The great lords, however (for there are many great lords among them), who have lands in the country, have, perhaps from a diffidence in their own abilities, not always the same degree of regard for their lands in cities, which they had for those at the country estate, or for the lands which they occupied at the court. Their lands in towns are commonly mortgaged to their own immediate heirs; their lands at court are not, and cannot be. The greater part, accordingly, of those at the country estate have no interest to employ any of the capital which is employed in them in the cultivation and improvements 


LEGALLY O BLOGGED, PG 110


The greater part, therefore, of such at the country estates have no interest either to cultivate or to improve their estates, in the same manner, or in the like proportion, in which private people in like circumstances cultivate their own. They are, in fact, generally more interested to sell their own corn at a good price, and to purchase, with their own money and stock (for the great lords are generally richer than the common people), what may be called the conveniencies and luxuries of life.

In the greater part, too of those at court, the interest of their own person, and of that of their family, is not, like that of merchants

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 108

, the sole consideration. The honour of the family, of its own importance, depends upon that success of its projects, which can alone secure to it, in the course of the year, a certain annual revenue, sufficient to maintain, at all seasons, its own officers, servants and slaves, and, at least, to pay the wages of such a number of menial servants as are necessary for performing the office of keepers, messengers, and carriers, for the conveyances which must be frequently carried on. In those remote periods of time when the family was poor, and when the husbandman could not well expect any thing but his daily labour to support him, his interest was not the sole consideration; and his conduct might be regulated in much the same manner by that interest as by that of the merchant, whose capital, if it could be accumulated into a great sum of money by the trade which he carried upon it, might be of great value, and consequently command a great share in public deliberations. The interest of a gentleman, like that even of the merchant, was not, like the interest of the merchant-adventurer, founded altogether in speculation.
The price of corn, therefore (though, from the nature of its production and consumption, liable rather to fluctuate than gradually to rise or fall), though not regulated in this respect in ancient times, has, in modern Europe, been regulated in exactly the same way. It varies with every variation of price, in every rise and fall in the real value of silver, according, not to its intrinsic quality only, but, in a great measure, to its situation in a European market; according, therefore (for it varies everywhere according to circumstances which are very different from those in the present circumstances of the country), to the competition of the neighbouring states, and, therefore, to their mutual interests in the regulation of the prices of their commodities.
The price of butcher's flesh, for instance, in Great Britain, varies very little from one year to another. The average price of beef, according to the accounts which I have had of several different market places, in 1755, and 1756 (two different periods, I believe), amounted only, it appears from these accounts (and it is by no means certain), to about L.1 : 6 : 6½. The average price, too (according, it is probable, to a great degree, to the competition between different abattoir-keepers),

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 109

of the best wheat in the year, is generally about three-and-twenty pence an bushel; and this price, it has been said by Mr. Gardener,[40], is nearly equal to that of the quarter wheat, which at that time was considered by all men of letters as one of the most proper and wholesomest for human food.

In 1722, accordingly, Mr Gregory King, an eminent authority on agriculture, estimated, according to this method, both the real value and that which he called the natural price, at four-and-fortysix pence the quarter, which, according

The real price of the greater part, it must always be observed, of the rude produce of land in the present times, is not only much lower than the average value which is usually given for it in the accounts which are published of the prices of corn, and of many other parts, both of cattle, and of grain, in particular, but it is generally much higher than the lowest average rent which is commonly paid to the landlord for a certain acre of his land.

In the account which has just been published of the average price of the greater part of grain at Windsor, it has already been observed, that the highest value of the year, that of 1722 (the year at which this account begins), was L.3 6s. 4d. sterling, equal to L3 4s. 6d. of the money price of silver. But the real value of that part of the price of grain, which was paid for it by the landlord, is not equal to this highest sum; and it is not only somewhat lower, but it frequently happens that the greater portion, and frequently all the larger portion, of the price, is altogether paid away by the landlord. In 1721 and 1723, accordingly, the price of the greater portion of grain was L.3 4s. 4d.; and in 1724, 1725, 1726, the whole price of it (according to this same account), amounted to only L3 4s. 8d. sterling.
The real price of the quarter, therefore, which, in those years, was paid for wheat, does, in the same manner, not bear a regular proportion to its natural or the average value, which is the price paid in all years.

In the accounts which are

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 111

kept of the produce and expense both  of land, houses, and labour in every country, we seldom find any considerable over-trading of one sort, or any great deficiency of any other; because the greater part, both of the former and of the latter, being either consumed or produced within the year.

The accumulation, either of treasure or of gold and silver, which is either necessary for carrying out a treasure, or for paying a bounty upon the exaltation of a certain treasure; the accumulation which is made either of such treasures as are destined to be buried in some particular place, or which, though destined to be deposited in a particular place (for example, in the treasury or in a public-house of some city), is brought into it by a transfer of title, and deposited with a particular person for safe-keeping; such accumulated riches are, in most cases, necessary, not for carrying out, but for keeping, and are therefore, not accumulated, but spent.
The expense, therefore of maintaining, first, those treasures, which, being brought from foreign countries, and of which the value cannot well exceed that of the whole produce which they could purchase, are, in the ordinary case, not accumulated; and, secondly, such gold and silvers which have been brought from home for the purposes above described, and of this value, not only are not accumulated, as the surplus is immediately sent out of the country to purchase more of the necessaries of the people, but, if you except a very small part which goes abroad for the purpose either  of paying bounties or to maintain foreign wars, is generally, after a few years, spent, and is brought back to replenishment, not in the way of a treasure or a gold and silver deposit, but by some new expense of the like nature; either by the expense of building, or of repairing houses. The whole expense, however (I say, the whole of this expense) which is made either of these, or which, as the transfer of a particular treasure for safekeeping, or for the purpose above mentioned, consists in, can scarce ever exceed the whole annual produce of the land and labour of the society, and is scarce always much more.

When the whole of any nation's revenue, either the whole of the produce of the lands, houses, and labour, of the whole country, or only of some part of it; is employed in purchasing treasure or

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 112

war, it must necessarily be spent, not in maintaining productive labour, but in maintaining unproducible. It must, therefore, produce nothing for its own consumption, but be destined to maintain a multitude of productive labourers; and, as the whole annual expense must be over and above the maintenance and employment of those labourers, it must, too, occasion some revenue to another set of productive labours. It is this second set, however, which I shall consider hereafter under the head, of the fund which maintains productive labour.

The stock, it may be said at the end of this chapter, of the sovereign, and of all other great lords, must necessarily circulate in a great society; for if it did not, the people would be obliged to employ it, either in purchasing the materials of building and repairing, the furniture and instruments of trade, the equipage, provisions and household furniture; or, if they were poor enough, in maintaining unproductive hands, in the same manner, I suppose as the people in ancient times were obliged, I imagine by the law of the country, to maintain those unproducible labours who maintained them. But though it necessarily circulates in such a great country, it does not seem necessary that the circulation of this great stock should extend through every part of it; because the people of some provinces can, in most cases, easily carry out their stock from one part to the other. In some particular places it is more convenient, and even essential, for the people of some particular provinces, to keep a great part of this stock in their own houses, than for them to send it abroad; as, for example, the greater part, I believe, of the money of Holland. In others, it seems necessary that the people of some particular provinces send a considerable part of this great stock to foreign countries, for exaltation and conquest; and it is in this case that the circulating money of Great Britain must, for the present at least, chiefly reside, and, therefore, be confined to the British colonies.

In Great Britain there are several branches, indeed (for there are many different ways in which the stock and credit, or money, may be divided), in some of which there is a very large circulation, in some of them a very scanty. The greater part, I apprehend, of this great stock is in Great Britain. The greater part is, perhaps the greatest part, in the colonies

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 113

, where it has been allowed to lie fallow. The other part goes to Great Britain and to the plantations.
The stock, therefore, which the colonies are supposed by themselves to possess, is, in reality no more than a part of that stock, which the countries to which they belong, have both in their own possession and in that to be had by means of the trade to which those countries are open, either immediately or through some of the slower navigable rivers, such, for example, as the Rhine. The stock, accordingly which is annually brought to the plantations by all those different trades, must, in the course of a year, amount at most, perhaps not much more than one half of that which would otherwise have been annually imported into them; and this, too, though the whole annual importation might be equal to that of all England during the same period.

The stock which, by the trade to which the colonies were open, the mother country could have had, if she had been disposed to employ it in her own way, was, the year before last, supposed to consist altogether, not so much in gold and silver, but in tobacco. The quantity brought from Europe, in consequence of that particular branch of foreign commerce, was supposed to be equal to what might have been employed in purchasing that produce in its native country, or in the tobacco plantations. But this stock was supposed not to be employed in the cultivation of land. The tobacco, therefore, which, by the commerce to which the colony trades were open, the mother country was supposed to have had was, in the same manner, not so very considerable a stock as might have been employed in the purchase or improvement of land, or in building houses and other buildings for habitations.

It is not the number of people only, but their natural abilities and talents which compose this natural and original capital, or which, as it were, forms it. It arises, therefore, partly from natural abilities and talents, which are acquired by education, and which are in general the best rewarded in every society, but partly likewise from the good conduct, the good use of those abilities, which, though rewarded by education only, are in great part the effects of the good management and good usage of those talents.

Education, besides the advantages arising to individuals from the good management of their own education, is likewise advantageous to the society in its own way, and consequently contributes towards forming the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 114

character and habits which it is intended the public ought to form; and the same thing may be said, with equal reason, of the maintenance and employment of teachers. In all great commercial countries, therefore, the wages and profit both of labour and of capital are generally higher in cities than at remote points of the country, or even at the same distance, though in different employments.
The wages of labour in cities are commonly higher, not because they are more plentiful there, but because they are generally more liberal. The competition for the employment, and the difficulty and danger of finding a suitable employment, make it more advantageous for a person who has a stock of goods of any kind to purchase of the merchant, or the undertaker of some great works, a greater quantity of those articles, than if he had been obliged to buy them of a smaller number. The profits, too (though in this case the advantage must generally be against those who trade in towns, as the returns must frequently be slower), though they are lower than they are at distant points of the country (where there are no exclusive corporations), yet, in most cases they are still superior to those of foreign trade. The greater part, and in almost all cases the whole capital, of a great merchant, consists of goods of one kind or other; and it is upon this principle that the greater part of his capitals are employed in the purchase and transportation, of goods from distant parts to near ones, and from near parts to distant parts; and upon this principle that, in almost all cases, he makes the greater portion, and pays the greatest dividend, either to the proprietors of his lands or of the stock which employs them. The great quantity of his goods annually imported into the city from all parts, is sufficient to fill up the greater part of his warehouse; and the great quantity which, every day, is annually exported, fills almost all his warehouses; while, at the same time the small profits of the merchants in his neighbourhood are sufficient, by their annual purchases of foreign goods, both to pay their freight and maintenance, and to afford a moderate profit upon those purchases. The greater the quantity imported and exported, the more frequently the goods of all those different merchants will come in and go away together. The more frequently they come in and go out together (which, in all great towns, is nearly the same time every day), and the more regularly they do this, both those merchants, together with all those

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 115

who carry on their trade with them, become necessarily less numerous than if they were more dispersed, and less liable to be plundered by their neighbours; because the greater their numbers the less liable to be injured by their enemies. In the mean time, the quantity of goods annually imported into any great town from distant countries must always increase more rapidly in the hands of the dealers in the town than in that of the importers; because, in order that the dealer may sell his own goods in the market, it is requisite, first to collect them together into a great stock, and afterwards to sort, package, and ship them to some distant country. But if he had to sell his whole stock in the one place, the goods would soon run short, the trade being then necessarily carried on by the importers, whose numbers were always greater than the dealers in that place. The more frequent, the more regular, the less dispersed transactions of the dealers in any particular city or town are likely, upon the whole, to promote the general trade and consumption of the country, and to increase the annual produce of its industry in the most considerable degree, than the more irregular, the more scattered, or the more uncertain transactions of those who trade in foreign countries with our own; because those foreign trades are more likely to be carried upon by the same people who are continually buying and selling their own goods, than the foreign trades which the merchants carry on in our country, which are generally confined almost entirely to foreign countries, such as the carrying trade.

It is thus that, wherever a free import trade is allowed, a greater stock of the produce of domestic Industry is continually employed in supporting and supplying the inhabitants, both with the rude and manufacturing produce of the land, than where the monopoly is given to a particular manufacturer or foreign merchant.

The gross annual importations of all the rude and manufactured produce of Europe amounted, before the commencement of the present disturbances in France, to more that one hundred and twenty-five millions sterling, which, according to the most exact accounts, did no more, either in direct or in indirect expense, than what would be necessary for maintaining the inhabitants of that country, without either sending abroad or importing foreign commodities; that is to say the neat produce of the land and labour, without any of the expense of transporting either the manufactured or foreign goods from one part of the country, to another. The whole annual importation of the rude, therefore, was more

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 116

than paid away by means both of the circulating and of the stored-up produce of the land. The annual exaltation of the currency, by means of its purchasing the surplus produce, and thereby raising the real wealth of the country, was, in reality, only the repayment of a debt which had already, at an earlier period, been paid off by the annual produce of the land and labor of that country, together, it would seem, with the ordinary profits or wages of stock. It was a repayment of the interest of the money borrowed; but the interest of the money was paid off in a much more convenient manner, by the revenue of that country which, at the end of each period, was advanced to its creditors in the same proportion in which that debt was repaid.

It has already been observed how advantageous a banking company may be, by means of a discounting loan, of augmenting, at least, the value of the money of a great society, without either the loss of any part of their own capital stock, nor any other expense of this kind. A private merchant may do likewise. He may, for a certain time, augment his stock by the sale of some part of it. He is enabled to buy a new coat, or a new pair of boots; or to make a present to his wife, of a present, whatever it may have been. But a private merchant who lends his stock to a bank, must always lose something by such sales. He must lose the price of the new goods, which he purchases with the stock borrowed, and which, if he sells at all, must always bring back something less than the price of the old goods which he bought with that stock. He loses, too the profit upon this stock; because, though he may gain the rent and interest of the money which he advances to the bank, the bank will lose the profit which it might have made from that part of it, had he not advanced that money to him in the first place. He must lose both this rent, and this interest, before he can afford to make this purchase; and the greater the number of such sales, the less likely it will be for him to make this purchase with any considerable stock at all, and consequently the smaller, the more so, the proportion which the bank must necessarily lose by the whole quantity of money lent. The bank, however, by lending this part only of its own capital stock in this manner,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 117

and without drawing back any part of the principal from the other two parts which it keeps by itself, is enabled to maintain, in good order, a very large quantity of money in its coffers, which it is not likely to do without such extraordinary assistance. The circulating money of Great-Britain, at present, is not supposed to amount to L500,000, or even L600,00,000; and if we should add the value of what was borrowed to that of L1,500,000, or even L1,600,000, the annual produce of its industry might be sufficient, it is supposed (though this is not, I apprehend (p.119), expressly stated in the present accounts), to maintain the same number of hands in constant employment which that annual amount would maintain in a year of moderate prosperity. The bank is, in this case, a public utility; and the public can have no objection that its capital should be employed in lending money, and in maintaining money-credit in the country, in proportion to the extent and the regularity of its business.

In the following book, I shall endeavour, as much as possible to give a clear and distinct account of the different operations of the Bank of England, in the management of the money of the country; in order that, as much at least as possible, every person may have a full and fair idea how much the circulating capital of the country, or the whole stock of money in it, has increased and diminished in consequence of all those different transactions which have taken place in its offices.


CHap. I

OF BANKS IN COMMERCE AND COMMERCIAL STOCK, OR OF THOSE WHICH HAVE PRODUCED OR SUPPOSED PRODUCTS, AND HAVE LOST THEIR EMPLOITS. The Bank of Scotland, for example, which, in the course both of the war and of the Revolution was so very active in the support of the king, is, upon that very account, represented by some as a private banking house, and is, accordingly called in that character; while the Bank of England is represented, by others, as a great public utility.

I shall begin with the most important of those two characters; and, after examining briefly all those different banks, which, in order to promote the interest either of commerce or of stock in the country, either by lending their own stock to the dealers or borrowers of those different

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 118

sorts of goods, have, for a certain number of years past, issued their own notes, and given credit to those who had them; I shall consider in what circumstances, and in which order they must necessarily be preferred, before any consideration is had of those which issue their bills of exchange, either upon the deposit or with the payment of those deposits. The first character, the circulation of cash, seems to be of very recent introduction. The practice, however (which it is impossible to prevent), is everywhere prevalent among merchants and manufacturers. The money they have upon their persons is not always sufficient for the whole purchase which they are likely to make, either of the materials of the goods they are selling or the instruments of trade which are purchased with those materials. A part of this money, or, what comes nearly about in the same manner, the bills of exchange which circulate upon this part of their cash, is, perhaps too, frequently employed as a fund for paying such purchases. But whatever part of the circulating cash is thus employed in purchasing goods, the merchant or manufacturer, in order to make a complete sale, must, upon some occasions (for there is no rule, which can ever be infallible), advance the money which must be paid for the use and consumption of those consumable commodities; or, what comes nearly about the same thing in the same manner, must give credit for the use of the money upon deposit with those dealers or borrowers of goods, which, he expects to sell at a price which will pay the interest, or, what comes near to that price, the value added upon the money by that interest.

The second character, paper money, seems to have been common in every civilized country, from ancient Egypt, where, as in Europe, all public transactions were carried on with gold and silver money, so the greater portion of the public transactions in Egypt, and even of many of those which are still carried on by means of it, are carried on in the present times by the bank of England; that is to say by the paper of this company which has been granted a monopoly of banking within this kingdom; and by the bills, promissory-note, and receipts which, for a limited time, are allowed to be received upon those promissory notes, and which, as soon, however, as the law takes them away, are called in again by another company, called the Royal Exchange company.

The paper which circuites

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 119

in England is, in proportion to its quantity, always somewhat nearer the bank of England than that which circulates in Scotland, and it seldom happens that a Scotch bank gives credit to a London banker for any considerable sum which has been advanced by him, of which the repayment was never intended. But if a London banker, instead of taking out his cash, should deposit a sum of Scotch bank notes, which were immediately circulated in Scotland, and of which the repayments were at all times to be expected from the Scotch bank, he might thereby promote, in one respect, the circulation in Scotland, at least as much as he could have done if he had taken out his cash, and he might thereby encourage the Scotch people, in another, to continue the improvement which they had begun before the union. If the Scotch banks were obliged, therefore (for I do not pretend that they ever were) to receive, with the same facility, such sums as those which were regularly paid to the English bankers by their customers, the Scotch people might, in the course of a few years, have become a great deal more prosperous, than the English people at present. The union, however, would probably, in all probability (which is not the same thing), be attended with some considerable    The union, however (which I say I do not pretend, either to prove, or even to conjecture), has, perhaps, been attended, in many respects (which I shall explain hereafter), with a good many inconveniences, which have been the natural consequences, both  of the union itself and of the particular mode of conducting the government in the two different provinces of which it consisted.


 CHAP. VII.

OF A REVOLUTIONARY OR DYNAMICAL CONQUEST OF THE SOUTH OF THE BRITAIN STOCK OF THE FOREIGN COUNTRY. The South of the British empire being, in all probability (and this I venture to affirm without the least probability, and, in fact (for there are many reasons for believing that the probability must necessarily be less than I imagine, in the case which I have supposed), in reality, but very probably very much less), in all probability, the most fertile market for British manufactures; the union, if it has been productive of any thing but ruin to that country; the establishment of a system in which all the different branches of the national produce may, upon most occasions, all find their market in one common channel;

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 120

in all probability, if there is any thing at least to recommend this union besides its being productive of this ruin; the establishment of a banking system, in which the credit of the nation is, as in all other countries, secured to those who lend money upon demand; in which, instead of the uncertainty and risk of private bankers, there is a certain degree, and in which the certainty of getting payment is as certain as the returns are frequent; if all these things are true, the South of the British empire is certainly in the happiest situation that can well be imagined, and, in consequence of the union, must probably be in that situation to-day as ever.] The South, indeed (for it is not, I apprehend, altogether so happy as the whole empire) has been, and still is, in a great measure, oppressed by a system in which the different branches, both of the public revenue and of the public credit of Great-Britain are, upon most occasions, all kept in the same bank. But, in order that this oppression may have some effect, it must, upon some particular days, be attended to, and upon others not; and upon the former occasions, this system must be subjected to some regulations, in order to prevent the exorbitant profit of those whose conduct either directly or indirectly tends to disturb it; and, upon the other occasions, this system, though subjected to no regulations, yet receives from government the benefit, both of the protection and the encouragement, which it could never have otherwise enjoyed. The banks of England have, upon most occasions, been very liberal with regard to their customers, and very exact in their dealings with government. The government, in return, have, in many cases, given them extraordinary encouragement. In 1741, the bank granted, at an annual interest, L.5,000 for each annum, to the first subscribers to a paper called the Public Credit, which was to be issued by government for the payment, both of the debts and of other expedients. In 1742, they granted another like sum to the subscribers to the paper entitled the Revenue, which was to pay in kind the sums borrowed by government for paying its bills; the bank agreeing to receive, at the same rate, the whole sum borrowed. This second subscription amounted to L.3,600,000, at four years purchase; the first, to only L1.2 million, at six years purchase. In 1745,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 121

the bank of England had advanced to government the whole value of what was then due to government for its annuity upon a new annuity of L.3,333 : 1 : 10½; that is, for L.1,000,000 of new annuity paper. The annualling of the public debts, which began about this time, completed this great round of paper payments, which had continued, it is probable from about 1740 till they were all paid off by the late recoinage of the bank of Scotland. The annual annualling of these debts amounted, in all, at an average of ten years, to more than L500,00, or five hundred and twenty thousand sterling. In consequence of the late recoinage of that institution (which, in 1759, reduced its circulating cash to about twenty-five millions, or to L22,333,333 : 17 : 10½), its current money has lately been reduced to L16,333,333 : 17 : 9¼, and the whole value, including what had been paid in, to about L21,333.33. In the year ending June 30th 1764, the public debts were still greater than those of 1765. The public debts of Scotland had, during this period of sixty-four years, been continually increasing, while the public money, which was employed about them, had been constantly diminishing. The annual sums due from government to itself had, between them, been increasing more or less in every successive year. But in that year, the whole public debt, which at this moment, may be supposed, to be discharged altogether, was, according

 

The quantity, however, of this current money, or paper money which was in circulation at the end of each successive year, must have been continually increasing in proportion to this increase of public debt, or, in other words, in proportion as it became more and more difficult for the government to pay the annualling debts. In 1766, when those debts had, by this recoinage of government money (which had, during these sixty-eight or seventy years increased the whole national debt

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 122

by a hundred and fifty millions, or more, than the whole value of the British coin which circulated in the country), become altogether too great to be paid with the gold coin of Great England, a part of it, at least, of what remained, was to he melted down, and made into bullion; so as that the whole debt might not, by any possibility, be paid without a great increase in the gold coin.

In the year 1773 (by an act which was afterwards revived and confirmed by several subsequent statutes), the gold coin, instead, of one shilling a-pound, received from government, as usual, a twenty shilling coin; and the quantity of silver, at one time reckoned at four ounces, or sixteen thousand pounds weight (one-fourth part of a pound of our present money), was now reduced to three quarters of a pound, at two shillINGS and eightpence of our money, the standard money then used in England, instead, perhaps of six ounces of fine silver. The paper money of Great Britain thus became, during the continuency of this extraordinary course of public transactions (for though it began, before 1773, to diminish gradually from the annual sum which it amounted, till it fell short of the annual amount), somewhat heavier than the coin of the country, and somewhat lighter than what is necessary for carrying on the greater portion, or even the whole business, of the commercial world, of the trade of Europe, and the East Indies, to which Great Britain belongs; a circumstance which may be compared to that of a man whose weight is gradually reduced from his ordinary state, of about six hundred pounds weight to that state in proportion which is necessary for him to carry it on. The quantity of gold and silvers which can be employed, and of what value, without this paper money, being gradually lessened and lessened from year to year, the value which can afterwards be placed upon it being gradually increased from the greater part of the gold which can afterwards be got, and which can be employed in purchasing this gold paper; a great part, I believe, of it must always remain in that condition in which it can neither purchase, nor be sold, for any thing else than its value, or what is equal to that value, or for no more than what it is worth. But if the paper money, instead of sinking gradually to the value of the coin, continued to rise in value from one year's

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 123

date to another, and if, instead of the usual number of banknotes issued, a greater sum was frequently issued, the same number of banknotes could not always circulate as fast, nor the same quantity be received and spent in the different parishes of Scotland. In those parishes, the scarcity occasioning the scarcity of money would soon make it impossible to circulate the same sum with tolerable exactness; and as there would then be more paper than usual, more of the circulating notes of those particular parish banks would soon be rejected, returned upon their owners as uncollectable, or melted down into other articles, which the owners would find convenient to purchase or to employ. The paper, instead, of continuing to increase, or even, what would have been the same case, to continue to diminish, would gradually grow smaller and smaller. In the course of a few months it would probably cease altogether. But the circulation of the country, which had before been carried along by means of the greater part, perhaps, but certainly of some part of that circulating paper, which was, after a certain time, necessarily thrown out by this decay in the value, would, from this day, be entirely carried along by means of the smaller and still more distant part of that circulating paper; and though the whole circulation of the kingdom might not thereby necessarily become much less extended, it would certainly, from this day forward, be more and more confined within narrower and straighter limits.

In Scotland, therefore (the Scotch banking companies being the only banks there that issue too much paper for any considerable length of time), the circulation is, by every account, very sparingly used; and though the whole circulation may be somewhat more confined than in other parts of the kingdom (by the smaller and still more distant circulation of the bank notes), yet it is not confined so much by any great difficulty, but rather by the smallness of the sum which can be employed, and by the small extent and distance of the territory which is commonly covered by any considerable sum circulated by means of the bank of Scotland. The bank of Scotland, besides, though it issues a very great sum annually, yet the circulation of the country is not so very extensive. In all great towns, the people are seldom without either a bill upon the bank, or some other paper which they have paid into it, and which they frequently keep by them for some time after it comes into the hands either of the banker who issued it

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 124

, or of some person whom he trusted, and from whom he was not very careful to remove the moment that he thought proper. If he had been, the paper might, perhaps have been lost altogether, or, if it had remained, might, perhaps, have been melted down into a sort or mass, of which the pieces might have been sold for the price of the paper, or, what comes to the same thing, might, perhaps, have constituted a fund destined for carrying on a particular trade, or for carrying on some branch or branch of business, in which those pieces were likely afterwards to be employed. The people of Edinburgh have always found great security in the paper which the banks give them, even when they are not under any immediate necessity of paying it. When the bank gives them credit to pay a bill for goods to which no credit is allowed, it generally adds a clause, obligating them to repay this credit, together, perhaps, with a considerable overcharge. This credit, too, when paid by a subsequent creditor, generally entitles the debtor, upon demand, to take out another bill upon that subsequent debtor, upon the credit of the original creditor; which, in the same way, enables the former debtor, when he has got this credit again, to demand payment of that part of the debt upon the same credit with which he had received it. The security of the Scotch banks, accordingly, has been so well established by practice and usage, as to render this redundancy, which it is meant should never happen but once in the life of any particular bank, almost impossible to occur, or to occasion the ruin of any individual or bank.
The banks of Edinburgh are said to have given this security for a long period of years, without any exception. Merchants, who had bills to settle with other merchants, were obliged to wait till such time as the bank gave credit for payment. The bank, however, when it had got this credit again (and it seems frequently got it twice in one day), was very apt sometimes to multiply its bills so much, and to make such an exorbitant demand for payment, as to ruin the merchant who was forced to wait for it; and when it happened to make this exorbitant demand upon the same merchant, the bank was frequently unwilling, or unable, either to advance or to take any notice. It seems, however, that the banks of Edinburgh were not always under the greatest pains to conceal the fact,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 125

that they had advanced to traders, upon such extraordinary exigency as their circumstances required them to occasion, very great sums of money; and that in many particular trades, the whole capital which was at any one time employed in them, might be withdrawn from them in this way. In the year 1712, for instance, when a famine was beginning in Scotland, they advanced to Mr. Douglas, their merchant banker, upwards of L.1,500; and, in 1713, L.2200. In those two years they advanced him upwards of £30000. In consequence of this great exigency, they found it convenient to discontinue his trade, which they had thus extended to such an extraordinary degree.

The bank of Scotland is said, in the course of a few years after its establishment in 1710, to have made several advances, of a much greater sum, to individuals and companies, upon such very extraordinary emergencies as arose among the undertakers of public works, such, for example, as those which happened in 1745 and 1747, when the works of Dunfermline were being completed, and when the river Clyde was navigable for the ships of the shipping-coast of Great Britain. In those two years, they lent to the undertakers upwards, at interest, upwards of L.10000; and, in consequence of these advances, the whole value of what had been borrowed upon those two expensive projects, together with the ordinary profits of banking, amounted only to L.2,000, which was paid back upon the same terms, within six months. The greater portion, or, as they express themselves, the greater part of their capital, therefore remained with them, to be applied to other purposes. In consequence, in less than six months, they had made another advance, of L.4,500, upon the credit, as they express it, of Mr. Douglas, their merchant banker, and repaid him with L.1,500, which they had again advanced upon the same terms, within six weeks, by making yet another advance of L.30000, upon the credit, it appears, either of another merchant or individual of whom they had some information. The bank of Scotland is supposed to have advanced, in these two extraordinary emergencies, upwards, in the course of a few months (1710 and 11th November 1711, 1712, and 11th November 1715), upwards of L.3

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 126

,500,000, which was, upon that day (the 11 th November 1715), about three and a half millions of guineas. This sum had been borrowed of some of those banks, of the greater number, at very low interest, for periods of several years. The other three and half million was borrowed of some of the smaller banks; so that the whole amount of this loan, which was advanced by all the different banking companies in Scotland, may have been upwards, it is probable, of L.6 or L7,000,[40]000, at the lowest interest.


In 1712, the year of the great distress, Mr Hume, in the course of his annual report, gave an Account of the state and conduct of the public credit, both at home and abroad. He observed that, in consequence of some new regulations of the Bank, which he himself had made in consequence of a complaint of its negligence, it was now much easier to borrow of it; that the ordinary discount of bills was now reduced from nine to five per cent.; that, instead, therefore, of borrowing at six per cent. for ten or twelve months, as before (for which there had been two different reductions in the rate of the bank notes, one in 1692, the other, about the same time, in 1710), one could now, with much more safety, borrow at four per cent.; that this saving, therefore, amounted only to a small part of one-fifth, or to one-sixteenth, or one half of the interest, which had always, before, belonged to the bill; that this saving, therefore, could not compensate, with any considerable profit to the lender (who, it must be remembered was not himself the borrower), the loss occasioned by the extraordinary high rate at the Bank; that the ordinary discount was now at five per cent., and the bank notes, therefore (for which there was another reduction in their discount, from nine to five per cent.), at four, three-fifths and one-third per cent., the same rates as at the Bank; and that, in order to relieve this distress, the Bank was, in consequence of those new regulations (which it was his duty, he pretended), to reduce the rate of interest in all its branches from eight to four, from six and one-fourth, to five, from four and one-fourth, the same rates at which they had been

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 127

before.

This reduction in the interest rate was supposed to be sufficient to relieve, in some degree, all these 

 The Bank, though, by the extraordinary measures taken with regard both  

The bank, however, had, upon different occasions, reduced the rate of interest in some branches of trade below what they were accustomed to give in others, yet the general state and direction of trade never seemed to be in any degree affected by any of those reductions; on the contrary, in the most flourishing years that the bank has ever seen, the trade has generally been rather increased than diminished by them. In 1697, when Mr Lawe reduced the legal rate of bank-notes, the value of the silver coin was so much diminished, and that of all commodities was so much increased by the excess of gold, that the value both both of silver and gold amounted only to L.2,800,000 : 8 : 6, which is about twenty-six thousand pounds, equal, at four shilling and six pence, to about twenty-one thousand four hundred pounds sterling. In 1699, when Mr Dupré de St Maur told us, that in consequence of the reduction of the bank notes, his own stock was so much augmented by their exorbitancy, that he was obliged to borrow a large quantity of money, he gave an account of his capital at thirty years of maturity, which amounted only to about ten millions nine thousand four thousand pounds, equal at two shillINGS to about eighteen thousand four thousand.

The bank of Scotland, however, though it has reduced the legal rate of interest from six to five per cents. and that of all its other branches, from eight to four and three, has not been able to reduce that in trade below the former rate; and in 1698, at the expiration both of Mr Dupré de St Maurit and of Mr Lawe, it raised the rate still higher than it was then. In 1700, it again raised the rate of bank notes from six and one-third per cent. to eight and three per cents.; but the trade still continued at its old rate, viz. at four and two-thirds per cent.
The bank of England, in 1697, reduced the legal rate from seven to six per cent., but it raised it again to ten and four-tenths, in 1701; in 1702, it reduced it to seven per cent.; but it

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 128

is otherwise in all countries where paper is either a necessary, or an agreeable part of commerce, and the greater part of that paper, even of that which consists of bills of exchange, is paid in kind. The greater part of the bills of exchange which are current in Scotland, are paid by the holders of Scotch bank notes. Those bank notes circulate in all the different parts, both within and between the counties and nations, of the country. They are received in payment in the different towns, and villages of that country; and the holders of those bank notes are everywhere in every part of it. If the holders of bank bills of exchange, therefore, should combine together in any considerable town or village, it could easily be prevented. They might, however (for there are no laws to prevent it) agree to pay their debts by a common creditor, who would then give them money in exchange for their goods, instead of issuing bank notes. Such agreements have frequently taken place in England. The holders of such notes are commonly merchants and farmers, whose trade and farming interests are not so directly affected by the state of the country as those of bankers and other dealers of bank notes, who are more so. The trade and agriculture, however, of the country, being in general better than the trade and agriculture of the particular towns or villages which trade or cultivate in consequence of bank notes, are generally more affected than those of bankers.

The trade of those particular towns and villages is generally carried on by the traders, who are themselves obliged, in order to carry on their trade, either to have bank notes to pay for their purchases; or else to have such goods delivered to them in cash; or to have such money paid in as those goods. But the holders of those bank bills of exchange are not necessarily obliged, for any other reason, to deal with those traders, or even to have any goods delivered to them in this manner, but may, without any such dealer, buy goods in the market of some other town or village, of which those tradesmen and merchants have no such bank notes to advance them, or to advance upon the credit of those bank notes. Those goods, therefore, can be bought by the holders of those bank bills of exchange, and the whole trade of the country, instead  of going through a banker, may, in most cases be carried along with those holders.

It is only in countries, however, in which bank bills are a very insignificant

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 130

part of the circulating money of the country, that they can have any other influence than by rendering it a burden more and more to carry any considerable quantity either of coin or bank bills from one place of payment into another. In those countries, therefore the circulation of coin is necessarily more or less confined, in order that the circulation may be more and more extended; while that of the bills which circulate by means of bank notes, may be allowed to run as free as the greatest liberty of commerce and navigation.

The Scotch scheme of improving the credit of the country by establishing a banking company for a particular province, was not adopted, as we learn from the public registers of deeds, by any body of people but the parliament of Scotland. But it had, before the Union, been proposed, by the banking company of England; and though it had not been adopted by that company, yet it had received a good deal of attention and encouragement from the legislature, both at home and abroad. The bank bills of the bank, which had before this time circulated through all the greater part of Europe, were now confined within a much smaller circle, by means both of a more perfect system, of a more perfect security; and, what is perhaps still more important, the bank of England, which had always before had the exclusive trade to circulate them, became, by the union of England and Scotland, the banker of Scotland; and its bank bills were now allowed to circulate through all parts of the kingdom as free currency. In consequence, a great number of those bank bills were immediately sent out and exchanged in the greater part of the trades and plantations of Scotland, in exchange for a great number  Of these, some were received by new owners, who immediately issued bank bills to the amount of what had before been advanced by their former owners; others, when those owners had no other funds to give in return, and were obliged to sell what they had purchased of other people for bank bills, were received by other owners, and soon circulated again in a new market, in order that their owner, in the same manner, might again be enabled to pay with those same bills for goods of all different kinds.

Such is the nature of paper money, and such is likewise the effect of it upon the circulating medium of a country. But though paper money, even in a commercial country, be so much confined within narrower circles of commerce than coin; still it cannot be said that its effects upon the circulating

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 131

capital of any country have ever been altogether beneficial. The quantity and value of goods which can be circulated within the same circle, must always be equal to that which can easily circulate within it. If the quantity is too great, the value will sink below what can be paid with it. If too little, both the value of the goods and the revenue of the merchants who carry them to market, may rise to a level which is more than compensated by the savings of their expense; and if both the quantity and the revenue remain the the same, they must always remain below what the quantity of gold or silver would otherwise be sufficient to maintain. In consequence, the whole circulation may be either more or less under-stocked, and, consequently, either more or less overtraded or overburdened.

The circulation of every country must always be under-stocking in the same degree, if it has not been long ago overtraded, or overburdened in some degree; in consequence of a greater or less excess of the quantity of gold or silver, which, according to the established rules, ought to be employed about the business of circulation; but which, in consequence either either either of a change in the quantity, or in the laws which regulate the amount, either of coin, or of banknotes and bills, is either kept out of circulation, or put under too great a restraint. Over-trading, overburdening in some measure, is always a bad symptom, but over-trade and over-burdening in the most absolute sense, are always fatal symptoms, which, in a great country as rich as England was at this time, must have brought about a very violent revolution in its trade and economy. It was at an end in the end of the reigns preceding the accession of Elizabeth, and has been for a century and a half past. But though the quantity of gold and silver in England, at present, has not been augmented in proportion to that which was in it when she was last in possession of it; yet, from a wanton negligence, the law which regulates it has, for many years past (1764), been subjected, in some respects at least, to an arbitrary direction. The greater part, or at least, a very great part, of what ought naturally to be paid in the way of taxes to the exchequer, has been paid instead in the currency, or in paper notes and

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 132

certificates of indebtedness, of which so much has already been spoken, and of which so many more are continually coming into fashion. The quantity issued in this manner is continually increasing, as the greater number and wealth of people become capable of paying in paper money the whole annual expense which they have occasion for; or, what comes to the same thing, the whole annual value which their annual revenue affords.

In Great Britain, the quantity issued annually in the different denominations of bank notes is not supposed to exceed one hundred and forty-two thousand five hundred and twenty-eight pounds. The value, at the current rate of exchange (three shillings and eightpence the pound), is about six hundred thousand pounds, or at twenty shillINGS and eight pence the pound, equal to L.30000 a-year, or to about thirty years purchase at the present market price. But in France, at an average of the last five-and-twenty or thirty months, the circulation of the banks there, according to Mr Dupré de St Maur, amounts only, at an average, to L.20000 a year, which, with the ordinary rate of exchange, makes a value of L4000, equal to the whole annual expense of the government of France, at the rate of ten millions of livres the mark. If, in consequence of the suppression of those banks, which, in 1755, issued upwards of twenty-four thousand five hundred thousand pieces in bank notes and certificates of debt, there should now appear in France a circulation equal to the whole quantity issued in England during the last fifteen or sixteen years; if the French currency should at that moment purchase no more goods in England than the English currency had done during the same period, it would not, in the long run, purchase a greater quantity of goods in the other country. The paper of the English banks could purchase no greater quantity of British commodities than that paper had purchased before. The paper of the French banks would have purchased no more. It might have purchased, however, a still greater quantity, had not the government of France been obliged to stop a good deal more circulation than it otherwise would have had in the country, and to give up some of the most important branches, both of inland trade and of foreign commerce, in consequence of the disorders of the administration in that kingdom. In 1764, the bank of England issued in the name of the public, and upon the credit of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 133

government, a very large paper money, of which the denomination did not exceed one shill. This paper, too, though not of such extraordinary value as the Scotch paper money, had been issued upon much smaller circulation; for the circulation of Scotland is said to have been very considerable. It circulated in London and its neighbourhood for more than a year before it came into the possession of the bank, which had it immediately delivered into the custody of Mr Law. It had, besides, been drawn by many different people; and as it circulated among so great a variety, there were many different sorts and values, which, in order not to be confused, had been assigned, by different persons, to the different banknotes which circulated in the same city or neighbourhood. The quantity of banknotes issued upon this paper amounted to upwards of twenty millions of guinea, or about thirty years circulation of bank money, or about three hundred years before our present money was coined. The paper, too (for the circulation was very great) bore no interest, and, therefore (for that reason only) could not, without some loss, have circulated in any country but Great Britain.
The bank of England had no intention of lending the paper to private people, who wanted to circulate it by retail; and when it became necessary, in order to make payment, to redeem some part of it from the bank, the redeemors, instead of being obliged to pay in gold or silver, were required, under pain, of paying double the quantity of bank money for which they originally borrowed it. The bank, therefore, having received a very considerable sum, of what it considered as its own stock, in order not to lend this paper for less, was unwilling to redeem it at any other price but double its original price. In this state, therefore (it having received a very considerable sum, and not intending to lend any more), it was unwilling to pay the bearer the full value, or, what comes to the same thing, what the bearer might have paid for it, had there been no optional clauses. The paper was called a treasury note, or a bank note, because the bank which issued it, was supposed to be a treasurer of some kind. The holders, or, what comes to nearly equivalent the same thing, the creditors, were supposed, too (it having received the full amount, or the value which it really represented) to be debt-holders in the same manner as those who had lent

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 134

their cash to the banker. But though the bank was supposed to be a creditor, yet its creditors, as well as its debtors were not, upon that account called bankers; because, as bankers, they were supposed to borrow at interest. The creditors, or those who owed their money, being the only people whose money the banker was supposed to hold in his own keeping, it could not be called his savings bank. It could, indeed, be called his money stock, and was accordingly so called, and was, therefore, in England called a bank of England, though it was, like all banks, a private company incorporated under a charter. The creditors were the same, or very nearly the same, with those of any private banker. They were the holders, too, or, what is nearly the same, the borrowers and lenders, who borrowed at the expense of some one or other of the other creditors.
4. Paper money is a species of paper credit.

Paper credit, as it is the original source of money and of the power to make contracts; as it is that which makes possible, either immediately or in time of peace and prosperity (for it is a source of neither of those two things), must have arisen from a necessity, not only of facilitating the circulation of gold, but of rendering the exchange of silver more rapid than it otherwise would be. The necessity was this. If gold was to be got in exchange for silver as fast, or faster, than it could be made, there would soon come about a situation which would render it necessary to employ a great number of dealers in order to find a purchaser or acceptor for the part of their stock upon which was thus spent and distributed among so many different dealers; and this would require, not only a greater stock than could easily have been kept up by those dealers themselves (who could easily have parted with a great part of their stock, when they found that the price at which they could sell their own goods, or the money price of those goods, rose more or less above what was sufficient to pay their own wages and the ordinary profits of stock), but a stock, besides, which, as soon 



  ¾¾¼¾ ¾¾¼

  ¾

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 135

The whole quantity of stock, therefore (the greater or less part of it, perhaps, which is employed in purchasing and selling gold and silvers), would necessarily be greater in proportion to that which is employed merely in circulating the same, than in that employed in purchasing and selling either of the other metals; and the competition of the former would necessarily be much greater, than that of the latter, who could find buyers for only so great a quantity of either metal as their own competitors.
The whole quantity of stock which is annually withdrawn from every particular employment, into which the annual consumption of gold and silver might naturally be divided, and which would thus remain unemployed and unimployed, must always be equal to, and, in every particular instance, greater, than the sum of its annual values, or than the quantity of those metals which can annually be circulated and consumed in it. The competition of the former, therefore, being always greater, will always occasion, more than any other cause, the employment of some stock to exceed that which the circumstances and wants and abilities of individuals can maintain, and which, therefore, must always increase, more than the sum total of its values, the number of people whose employment can be supported by it, more or less beyond the natural growth of that total number.

The multiplication of dealers in the same branch, in order to find a purchaser for the whole of what is annually withdrawn from their particular business of purchasing and selling, necessarily tends to increase the competition, and to diminish, not only that employment which can be maintained altogether by the annual production and consumption, of gold, but that of every other metal, of which the annual production and consumptions may sometimes exceed that annual production and consumption.

It tends to reduce the value, not only both of the gold and silver annually withdrawn from circulation, but, by increasing the competition of dealers, even of those dealers who are continually withdrawing part of their annual produce and consumption from this particular business, it tends, more or less, both gradually, and in different periods, to reduce that value still further, till, by reducing it still more, the whole quantity withdrawn, or, what is nearly equivalent to it, that annual production, becomes, in all the different trades of trade and industry, such as they themselves think it, sufficiently small, or so insignificant, to occasion so great a multiplication of dealers, that no one can find any difficulty in finding a purchaser for the whole of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 136

it, or of supplying his own use, when it has been finally withdrawn altogether.
The revenue of government, which is paid from the annual produce, or, what is nearly equivalent, from the neat revenue which remains, after paying, first, the rent, and, secondly the interest of the stock reserved for immediate consumption, may, in this case, be said not only to consist in the neat revenue, or in what is annually withdrawn, or what remains, from all other sources, after replacing capital and circulating stock, but to be likewise derived altogether from that particular source. It consists in the neat rent which remains to the landlord, and, in consequence of its increasing greatness and extension (for it is always increasing, or at least it advances very slowly), in the neat revenue which is, in every country, continually diminishing, till at length, in the course of the present and subsequent century, it may very well be supposed to have become altogether non-existent.
The produce of the annual consumption, or the neat revenue which is annually drawn in from it by all the different members, both active and inactive, of the society, must necessarily be greater, in consequence of the increase of stock, than in the course either of the present or preceding century, because the stock employed in producing it must have increased. The revenue of government, however (which is, in the one case, the produce, or, in the second the neat revenue, of that stock), may, in this manner, continue, notwithstanding the increase of the capital employed in producing any part of its revenue, for several centuries together; and the revenue of the farmer, or the owner of land in the neighbourhood of a great city may likewise, in this manner continue, notwithstanding a great multiplication of the rude produce, and an equally great multiplication in that manufacture or trade which he carries on. The neat revenue of government may, in both cases, be supposed, for some time at any rate, not to be much affected by either of these circumstances.

But the revenue of the landlord, and, in particular of that class which is chiefly occupied in producing, manufactures for distant sale, must, in all such circumstances, and in the whole progress of the society, increase in a much more rapid rate, than either the produce or revenue, of any particular manufacture, or even of all manufactures. The produce, in every particular country, increases in a still more rapid rate, and, in consequence of all

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 137

those successive improvements in agriculture, manufactures and commerce which it has introduced, comes to be in a still more perfect proportion than before; and yet the rent of land continues always to increase in its own proportion.
The landlord, who has got possession of an estate of no great extent (for the improvement of the land, in most cases is not very rapid), may find it difficult, even with his own stock to maintain the same quantity of industry with what it used to do before, or, perhaps, to keep the same number of labourers and servants. The landlord must necessarily have recourse to the aid of government; and government, as it has the sole right of taxing, regulates the rent, or the quantity, which the landlord can afford to pay. The rent which the landlord can get from the improved and cultivated land, is necessarily regulated by two circumstances: the demand of that improved and cultivated land, and the annual produce, either, or both together, of that improved and cultivated land, which must, in this case too (though not in this case only, because the produce of the land was different before), supply the demand. The demand for the produce increases, or at least does not decrease; but that of that improved and cultivated land does, in every country, as its improvement advances. As its produce increases, so does its rent.

The rent, however (for the demand and the produce, as I shall hereafter explain, must be considered in a much wider sense than in that in the foregoing account, which has been limited to a single period), which the landlord could afford to pay, before the improvement, was regulated by three different circumstances; by the demand for that produce, by its scarcity in the country in which the landlord lived; and, secondly and lastly by that of the land, or the produce which could, in that particular country, be raised on that land, in consequence of the improvement, and in consequence of the improvement, cultivation, and population, of the neighbouring countries.

The scarcity of that produce in the particular place where it happened to occur (which, in the present case, was the scarcity of wool), determined first, the amount of the tax or tithe, which was to go towards maintaining that industry; secondly, the proportion, or degree of improvement, of what was to go to this industry, or, what is the very same thing, to the rent which that tax would raise upon the whole estate; third

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 138

ly, what, if any, particular part of this improvement should be reserved to the landlord, as rent for himself; and fourthly and lastly, what part, if anything, should go to other people, either by inheritance, purchase, or purchase with borrowed money.

If a certain portion, therefore, of the produce of such a farm, or of the revenue of a particular proprietor of land, was to go towards supporting an industry, it could not well be otherwise than that that portion should, first, be a fixed rent, which, being paid by the farmer, was, in reality, paid to him by his landlord; and, secondly and last, consist in some sort of improvement or cultivation. It was because, in the present case, this second and last component was not present, that the whole amounted only, in the one sense, or, in the other, to a tax. It consisted, in the same manner, in what might properly be called the profit or interest, which, being paid by the farmer, could not be otherwise than that paid by the farmer to his lord; that is to say, in a portion of his produce which, though originally destined for replacing, with profit, the capital employed in raising it, yet, in the end of the process of improvement, might be turned aside from this purpose to another; and that portion, too, was not always the same as that which, in the original plan of the farmer's improvement, would have replaced that fixed capital.

In a country which was advancing in agriculture, the surplus part of such fixed capitals would naturally increase with the increase of their employment; and whatever portion of this surplus was to be retained by their owner as rent, it could never exceed that portion. In the same manner, though in the progress either of manufactures, or of foreign trade, a great deal of the surplus portion of such fixed capital might naturally be reserved for the maintenance of other employés of the society, it would never be sufficient to replace, with profit, that capital employed in the improvement of land, nor even to replace that capital employed altogether, but in a part only, and always a small part, which was to be turned aside from the further increase of improvement.

The proportion which the produce of a particular land, in the progress of its improvement, bears  of its value, or, what comes to the same thing in the language  of economists, the rate at

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 139

which its produce is annually distributed among its inhabitants, determines the rate of its rent, and determines the quantity of labour which it can maintain in the society. The proportion of its rent to that part, or, what comes to the like things in the language of economists, of its price, determines the proportion of its profits to those profits, and determines, too, the number and the strength, of the employers or cultivators of this land.

If the proportion of its value to its rent, therefore, should increase with its improvement, its rent will necessarily increase in a greater proportion than the proportion of the value of its rent. If, on the contrary, the value of its rents should gradually diminish with its improvement; if the rate at which it was annually distributed to its inhabitants should gradually increase; if, in the same manner, its profits gradually diminish; the rent would necessarily diminish, in the proportion of their respective values, and their cultivators would soon cease altogether.
The landlord, however, though he should have the whole rent in his power, would still be obliged to employ some portion of it at home in the maintenance either of labourers and servants, or of other productive labourers, who could reproduce this part of the rent by the labour  of their work. He could not, therefore, employ the whole of his rent in maintaining such productive labour. The whole, or, what comes to like things, the most considerable part, would naturally go out of his house in order to find some way or other, of reproduc ing it at home. It might, indeed, as easily be reproduced there, provided that this was the place in which the labourer lived; provided, at the same time, that the landlord was allowed to dispose of the whole produce of his estate to such a person or persons, at what was then called a reasonable price; provided that the profit which the labourer could make from this sale was sufficient to replace the stock of the farmer or landlord which was employed to bring the produce thither; provided that this price did not, perhaps, at this time, amount to very great profit; and, lastly, provided, that is to say (for it is impossible, perhaps impossible to suppose otherwise, that the price should not at this time, in most cases, amount to very great profit), the labourer himself was allowed to live at liberty. In all such cases, the proportion which his revenue bore to his capital, or

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 140

what was left after replacing the fixed and circulating capital, must necessarily be very much greater than that of a prudent master of a trade to a private merchant.

The prodigal who lives by the trade of a shopkeeper, is as much under the influence of his own fancy as if he were a man possessed of some equally frivolous passion; because the profits which he makes from his stock are so much greater than those which are drawn from his capital, and because his capital is so much larger. The shop-keeper's profits are, no doubt, a good deal less than the merchant-importer's, because his stock must generally be much greater, but the trade itself must be much less profitable than that of the private merchant, who has no stock whatever.

It is not, however, so much because the trade of a shop-owner is a more lucrative one, than that either 




 


 

Of the private merchant, that he is under an irresistible necessity to live by it, but rather that his situation renders it more agreeable to him. He is a merchant; but his trade, like the trade which consists in the purchase and sale of commodities, has no intrinsic value, and can be acquired only by the use or application of stock. The owner of the stock which employs him has a right to the whole produce which it produces. But the owner of a shop, who has a right to the profits of all the labour which is employed in buying, dressing, and preparing his goods for immediate use and application (and this, too, is not the same thing with having a monopoly), can demand nothing but a part, or rather no part, of that produce. His profits consist altogether in the difference between what he gets from this particular use of the stock, and what he gives for it. They are altogether independent of the use which he may or may not have made, either in buying it himself, or, perhaps more properly speaking (and, in this respect, they are more nearly upon an equal footing), of what may or may not have happened in selling it to somebody else. His profits arise altogether from his capital. The owner of that capital, however, has a claim to a share of them; because, though they are ultimately owing to him, yet, as the owner, it is his interest that they shall bear some proportion to what is due from the profits of the trade of the shop.
11

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 141

) In order to increase the produce and value of the rude produce, the price of the manufactured commodity must be continually rising, till it becomes equal to or superior to that of the raw one; or till its price comes so near to the price of that of the rude as to make the former, in all cases where there is a competition, purchase with the greater part of their stock, the latter. The price, too, which the rude produces, must be continually increasing; and in proportion to the quantity of labour necessary for bringing them from their mother-land to that of the manufacturing town, to their final sale, must likewise be growing greater and more considerable every day. In the progress of improvement and cultivation, the quantity of manufactured goods which can annually be brought to market must increase, first, in consequence of a more extensive market, in consequence either of the extension and better cultivation of land, or of a greater improvement and population of those who live in the neighbourhood of the town. The quantity brought thither, however (which, by this account, is not limited, as it generally is, by any certain boundary, but which is necessarily augmented every day by new discoveries, improvements, and populousnes), will increase, secondly, in proportion as that of rude produces is diminished, and thirdly, and last of last, in consequence of the improvement of land.

In every improved country there must, besides, have been a certain proportion of manufactures, and of those which are carried to market, in which, the value of the materials and labour employed was such that the manufacturer could not find any market for his commodity, but must have sold it for a profit. In such cases, the profits of the manufacturer must have augmented in a much slower rate, or must, for want of a more extensive and better cultivated market, be still slower in augmentating, than they are commonly at present, in the rude manufactures which take place upon a large estate.

The value, too (it has already been observed), both of those parts which, in the rude produce, compose what may be called the rude produce of land and labour, must necessarily be continually increasing, in the same manner, or very near in proportion, as their respective rates of improvement, the rent of the landlord being necessarily increasing in a still greater rate than the profits 






 The Value, both  Of those parts which, in that which is called the Manufactured Produce,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 142

consist in that part only of which the Labour consists, which is afterwards consumed in making that other Part, or of the price of that Part. The Value both  Of the materials which compose the materials of Manufactures; and of that part of their price which consists in that price. The price of every Manufacture consists, first, partly in that part of its price which is paid for that part of its materials; and partly in what remains after deductING the ordinary profits of stock; that is, in the value which the employer derives from his own stock. The value of those materials, and that of their price, must always increase with the improvement and cultivation, and in a still greater proportion than their respective rates of improvement.


The price, too, which, in the rude materials, constitutes that of all manufactured commodities, is continually increasing, in a still greater rate than either the value or the rate of their respective rents; the rent of the land, in proportion to its produce, increasing much more slowly than either the profit of the undertaker of the work, or the value of the wages paid by him; and the profits of stock, as they rise more rapidly, so their rise also, as they do so, rise much more slowly.

That the value of those materials and their value of their price, therefore, increase more slowly than the rate at which they are improved, is a truth universally acknowledged; and it has given occasion, in different ages and nations of Europe, both to some absurd laws of taxation and to the most absurd systematize systematize systematize of taxation.
The absurdities which have arisen out 



The absurdities which have arisen out of these different systemsatize of taxation are of three different kinds; of taxes upon consumable commodities, taxes upon those parts of revenue which, though not immediately employed, are still supposed to circulate within, and consequently to contribute to the revenue and wealth of the society; taxes upon those which are not immediately employed, such as those upon houses, and lands, and upon those upon houses, lands and offices; and lastly, taxes upon the revenue of persons, such taxes as the land tax.

First, there have been some absurd taxes imposed in different times, which, though properly assessed, and paid by the person assessed, have never been thought reasonable, that the revenue and wealth of that particular person should contribute in the smallest degree to the support

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 144

or discharge of government. The following are among the most absurd. The king of Spain, it is said, when he wanted to raise a certain sum, levied an annual tax of one hundred thousand livres upon the great people of France; but he did nothing for the support or discharge of government, but sent out a few commissioners every January or February, who pretended that he was going to requisition the whole, but who really requisitions only the greater part. In 1736, this annual tax of one million livres, which had been levied by the same commissioners, and which, as it happened, amounted, in all, only  In the foregoing chapter, I have endeavoured to show how different taxes, properly proportionable and just, can contribute in the most equal manner to the support and discharged the debt of a state; and in the fourth book I have explained how different taxes may contribute to support the same debt.

Secondly. There are some particular taxes imposed for public utility, of such a nature, that they may be considered, even with regard both to the interest of money and to the support or discharging the debt of the state, as taxes of a peculiar kind; and which may either, firstly, raise a revenue, independent of all requisition, or, in other words from which nothing can be demanded but what can be got for it by voluntary contributions; or, secondly, be assessed and collected without any requisition, and may be imposed with such a degree of impartiality and wisdom, that, without any requisition whatever, they contribute to no purpose but that of making a revenue.

The ancient custom of levying a poll-tax upon the inhabitants, for the support and discharge, not of the king alone (for that part of it which was over and above defraysing his own expense was commonly applied to the payment, too), seems to be of such a nature, as may be regarded as of a peculiar kind. The people, who pay the tax themselves, are, in this respect, not so much obliged as independent contributors; because, in case the state should be in debt to the king, they cannot, for any considerable time, expect any thing but a reduction of the poll tax. In those ancient days the poll-head was a free person; and the sovereign, as he could afford it to him, might demand payment of it as he thought fit, without inquiring how much he owed. It is

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 145

in this manner that the circulating capital, or, as it were, the stock which maintains and employs the labour and stock necessary to carry on any branch of trade or business, comes to consist, either altogether in the capital of the person who trades or employs it, or, as it were, in the capital only of some other person; or it comes to be distributed among, and employed by a number or sets of people who all share in it in common. The circulating capital is the stock which maintains, or, as it are commonly called, replaces the circulating capital of the country, of the merchant, master manufacturer, farmer and labourer. The stock that is employed in maintaining, and replacing, that of the farmer and labourers, constitutes the fixed capital, and, as it are commonly called, the stock that maintains and replaces that of the landlords, farmers and men of property. The stock employed in both those different ways, is necessarily distributed to its proper customers, in the proportion which the circumstances of the trade or business require; and the proportion is always in proportion, not to the whole capital of each person, which is frequently not sufficient to maintain him in his proper business, but only to that part of it which belongs to his particular trade. It is in this way that, during a long period, the fixed, circulating, and circulating capitals of the society gradually accumulate into the three great classes above mentioned; and it is this order only of men that is continually advancing to better themselves in all the branches of their business; to acquire more wealth, to improve their condition, and, consequently, more frequently and more quickly to bring about that great revolution in the system which is meant by raising the rate or price of all those metals, which is the object of this present inquiry, or, in other language (which, I believe, is understood by every man who has had much experience in such inquiries) of the precious and valuable commodities which circulate in a country. It is the interest of the greater part of these men, therefore, to keep the rate of those commodities as high as they can, and to prevent that rate from ever rising too high; or to raise it only so far, as to keep the market price of the greater portion, and that only of the great portion of them, within a certain degree of moderation, or so as not to raise it too much beyond this moderate height, lest, in consequence either of the accumulation of riches in the country, or

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 146

the increasing competition, the price should fall too much.

It has already, in some measure, answered all these purposes, in the price, not of the rude produce, of which the land produces, in the first place, but of the manufactured and foreign produce; of what may commonly, and, for want either of better instruments of trade, of better machinery, of more extensive roads and communications, and in general, of every thing which requires either the application of more industry or of greater skill in the person who employs it. But in the second place, it answers them in a still higher degree, in that of the rude produce of land. In order to sell its manufactured goods cheaper than they can be made, the merchant must generally bid them up in order, first, to buy their price, and, secondly to get that price again, after he has sold them; or, to buy their price, and, again to sell them again; or to bid up their price so high as he thinks it worth while, not only for himself, but, in the interest both 






 The prices, not of the rude produce, but of the manufactured and foreign produce of the land, have generally, in every country where such prices are known to take places (which is, I believe, almost everywhere), varied with the rise and fall in the value, in that in the annual production of those commodities. In England, during the course, not of twenty or thirty years together, we find, not only the prices, not of the coarse, but of that part, which contains the precious metal, and which is wrought up in plate or jewellery, sometimes sink a good deal below the old high prices; sometimes rise a good deal above them, and sometimes fall somewhat a good bit below them; sometimes in the one year, and sometimes in the other; and in all cases in the same manner, according as, according to different opinions entertained by different people, either the annual, the half-year, or the monthly produce of that particular branch, happens, either to rise more or to fall less. In France and Holland, in the countries which border on England, we find the same prices, and the like variations, in all sorts of manufactures; in some of which, as in the linen manufacture, the annual produce is greater, in some of which it is less, and in all in which, as the annual, the half-year,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 147

or two-third of the calendar, falls upon some of them.

It is in the greater part of our manufactures that the capitals employed are chiefly lent out. If you except the spinning and knitting manufacture of Scotland and Wales, there is no manufacture, either in Europe, Asia, or the West India islands, which, so far, requires so much capital to carry on, and yet requires so little labour to prepare the materials, that the profits of those who lend it are not only very small, but frequently very small, too, when compared with those of the undertaker of that labour. The wages of the working people, indeed, are higher in some manufactures, than in others. In some, as in those of weaving linen, they are very high; in some, like those of making gunpowder, they are very low. The difference, however (for there are many different circumstances which may contribute to this difference), is always so insignificant that the whole industry of both, if it was perfectly managed, would not require more capital to employ, than what is commonly employed in it.
The capital of every artificer, it has already been observed, is the fund from which his revenue arises, either as rent to himself, or as profit to some one else, or as both. It consists, therefore (I have endeavoured to shew by and large, and without any exaggeration), of two parts; of his wages, or, what comes immediately after them as their source; and of his profits. The one pays him his wages; the other pays him his profits, which, in most manufactures, are commonly drawn from some one of these three different sources.

In all the improvements which have been either wrought upon, or suggested by the industry and ingenuity of Europe, one or other of those four sources has, at some times, predominated over all the others.

The industry, for example, which produces the rude materials of manufacture, and the instruments of trade, requires a much smaller capital than the manufacture of fine woollens. The capital of each artificer is generally only sufficient to purchase, with his own labour, those materials which he either finds or makes for himself; to prepare the instruments of trade for the use of those whom it is intended should employ them; and to maintain himself during that time during which it is expected that they shall use them. His revenue arises from the sale of those instruments, and his profit from their price

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 148

. The capital employed in the one trade necessarily employs some capital in the others; and it is only by means either of this or of some other employment of capital that any considerable revenue can arise to him from either. The revenue which he gets from his instruments, and which is the effect, not so much of their being sold, as of the use of them, must always bear a regular and certain proportion to their value. It is the proportion of this use which determines the value of all instruments of trade. The profits of all the different dealers are regulated, first, by their ordinary profits in the common trade of the neighbourhood; secondly, by their particular profits upon particular occasions; and, thirdly and last, by the ordinary profits or loss of all their different trades.
The ordinary profit of the farmer is the same with the ordinary profits of the farmer's neighbour, or the profit upon his land; but that of the manufacturer, merchant, artificer or retailer, is regulated, not so much by his own profits, as likewise those of the farmer. It arises, first, from the use or waste, as well of his own instruments of trade as of those of the neighbouring farmers; and, secondly, and last of his dealings, both with the farmer and with those who are dealers in his own commodities, in the one way, as with the manufacturer, merchant, and retailer of the other.

It is the surplus of profit over-and-above what must be paid to the farmers and other farmers' neighbours in the rent of their land which is destined for the maintenance of their instruments of trade; and the proportion of that over-and -above this maintenance to that maintenance which must go altogether to those whom they are intended to serve, constitutes what is called profit above subsistence, profit above the maintenance which can alone maintain them.

It is this surplus, this surplus of profit above the maintenance of those who perform the office of dealers in your commodities, and of those whom you employ as dealers in theirs, that regulates the real wealth or poverty of the society, or, what comes to the same thing, that constitutes the greatness or smallish of the fortunes of the different individuals in it. The proportion between that part of profit, therefore which resolves itself into wages or profit, and that part which is over and above this maintenance, constitutes what is called profit, wages and rent.


 CHAP II.

OF THE COMMERCIAL RISE OF

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 149

CAPITAL

In the first place, the whole expense of agriculture, of manufactures, and of foreign trade, must necessarily be divided among many more persons than those of the rude produce of land; because the capital which cultivates the land is necessarily employed in bringing it to market. The capital of a manufacturer is necessarily employed, first, in preparing his materials; and, secondly, in purchasing the materials of his own work. But though he should be the only person who employed his capitals in any of those three different ways, yet the annual produce which they annually employ, together with the profits of their owner, must necessarily belong, not only to him and his immediate successors, but likewise to many other persons, and may very properly, perhaps, be called their revenue.

Secondly, the whole annual produce, both the materials of the rude and manufactured productions of land and of the seas, must be distributed among many more persons, who are themselves all interested to increase the quantity of those productions. A great part, perhaps the greatest part, of this produce consists either in rude or manufactured goods. The capital employed in the one, may consist, not only in the instruments of trade and manufacture, but in money; and as the money, which circulates in the country, must be employed in transporting the instruments of trade and manufacture from one place of manufacture to another; and as the profits of the undertaker, of whom this capital is employed in transporting them from place of production to place of consumption, must be sufficient to maintain and employ the undertaker himself and his family, together with his servants, &amps.;&#8260; &#8260&#8260; likewise the capital of the manufacturer, who advances the wages of his workmen, and purchases the materials and implements of their work, may be considered, as a part, not only of the capital of that manufacturer, but likewise of that capital of the whole society, of the society in whose favour and protection it circulates, and of whose subsistence it is employed.


Thirdly and lastly; the annual produce, too, of what may properly be called the mercantile produce, must likewise, it has already been shown in the second book of this Inquiry (p. 463), belong, not to one person only only, but to many more persons than the produce of that produce, of land and labour only; because the profits of the merchants who advance to government the money,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 150

which is employed upon such productions, are a necessary, though a very small part of it, of the whole value of the produce. The capital of every particular person employed in agriculture, for example, is a part only of the annual revenue or produce of the land, and is employed only in supplying the consumption, not the production of other people; whereas that part of his revenue which consists altogether in profit is a very important part of the whole produce of the land. The capital of a merchant, too is, like that of every other person, a part of the annual produce; it is only employed in purchasing, or rather in lending money for the purpose of purchase. The annual produce is always greater than what is sufficient, either to maintain, first, the capital of every particular individual employed as a manufacturer, merchant or merchant's clerk, and, secondly the stock which maintains, third, that of the whole society, or, in short, the whole annual revenue of every civilized society, or what may be called its annual produce. The annual revenue, therefore, which, according to their own accounts, is advanced to the sovereign by all the different members of every civilized society, is necessarily greater than what, according to the accounts which have been published by Mr Dupré de St Antoine, it is said to have amounted only to one half of it; the balance of trade, indeed, notwithstanding all the declamations of the merchants against it.[50]
The annual revenue of all civilized societies, however, it must always appear from the accounts of the mercantiles which have been published by Mr Dupre de St Antoine, is, in proportion, it is evident enough from experience (and this, no suspicion of falsehood will prevent me now, I hope, from observing the same thing with respect to all such accounts), a good many millions less than that annual produce of land, and a great deal more than that of the labour, which is annually employed in cultivating and manufacturing the land, together with its ordinary profits, and of which the capital is the instrument or means employed.

In consequence of these different inequalities in the profits of stock employed in agriculture and manufactures; the capitals employed in those two different branches of business not only do not reside within the country which produces or employs those capitals; but, from a regard to the interest either to themselves, or to some foreign nation, they frequently travel to distant countries. The capital which is employed in manufacturing, and which

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 151

brings back a profit, must be employed with some regard to those returns. If the returns were so very distant that the profit could not compensate even the expense of employing the capital, there would soon be no employment for the capital, but in maintaining unproductive hands. But the returns of the home trade are, the greater part of the time (for the returns are always the most distant when the competition is the greatest), much nearer than they can be made to come by in a foreign trade of consumption.

The capitals of merchants and manufacturers are employed in carrying on foreign trade of consumption. They bring back a profit to their respective merchants and manufacturers; but the profits of the merchants and manufacturers themselves must generally bear some relation to what they have really brought back. The returns of the trade, therefore (when it is carried upon by independent adventurers and small companies), must bear a certain relation, more or less, to what has actually been brought home; to what the capitals employed in it have really earned. But in every country, the returns of the home trade are, upon the whole more or less, nearer than they are in a foreign one; more, in the case, even, than in the case of an equal capital of the most perfectly liberal and liberal trading company in London, which has, in every respect of which we are informed, the same capital as the capital of the greatest merchant-manufacturer in the neighbourhood, and of the same extent, too, and of the like utility. The capitals employed in a home trade are, therefore, necessarily disposed to bring a certain return; but they are disposed not so much to employ the same quantity of labour in the maintenance of that labour, or of any other quantity of labour at home, as in the employment either of a great number of unproductive hands, or in the carrying on of a foreign war. The capital which carries the goods from A into B is necessarily more employed at home, and consequently more employed at producing, than that which brings them from B into A; because it is the same capital employed in both places, in maintaining productive, as well in the maintenance of the unproductive, as in that either either of the great or of the small dealers in that branch of business. But in every country the returns of this branch of business, even when carried on by independent dealers, are, in the whole course, more or less, more or less, distant from those which are carried on in foreign commerce.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 152

The merchant who deals in foreign goods for his country, must, in order to carry them from one part 






 ¾¼¾¾ ¾¼¾¼¼



to another, either sail the sea between the ports of his own country, or carry them by a canal to some other port, in which the returns are more frequent. If the returns of his inland commerce were as frequent as those to his foreign commerce; if the goods carried either by sea or by canal were of equal value with the same quantities carried either by land, the whole trade might, perhaps, be conducted by an independent dealer. But if the goods carried by the former trade are of a smaller value than the same quantities carried by the latter; the returns would be still more distant; the whole trade might be carried on, in a great measure, by a foreign trader, and consequently, not only by a single, but by a numerous set of foreign merchants. If the returns of his inland commerce, too, should be of a longer duration than the same returns in the foreign commerce; if, for example (and I do not pretend that they always are), they should sometimes last three years, or five or six years, the merchant who carried them by sea would find it necessary, in order to carry them from one part  

¾¾ ¾¼

of his kingdom to the other (for he would not be able to do this, without a canal or navigable river being laid through his dominions, of a greater extent than that which he himself can navigate by land), to employ a large capital, either in purchasing, in the most advantageous manner, a greater number of shipping of the country to be transported; or, by building and equipping a larger number of ships of the kind to be carried, in making a trade of carriage, of a much longer duration than that of his own. The capital employed in either of these two ways would, in this case, naturally be employed in carrying foreign, and not domestic, goods from the place where it was to be employed to the places where it was to be sent. It is only in this way, by means of such extensive projects as this, that a merchant of great experience and ingenuity can make his whole capital appear sufficient for all the undert

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 153

akings of the trade. But it seldom is. The greater the extent of his capital, the less he will care to keep within its narrow bounds. He will generally employ a part of that capital in carrying on a foreign commerce of consumption, and the rest in carrying on a home commerce of a more domestic nature; or he may even carry on both at the same time. In the greater portion of all his undertakings, therefore, his capitals will generally increase with those of the society to which he belongs. They will generally diminish in proportion to those of the country from which he derives his profits; but in proportion to those of some foreign country, in proportion to the capital employed in the trade, which is, in most cases, much smaller than the capitals of his countrymen; and in proportion as this trade has been carried to such an extent, it has generally afforded a more extensive market to a greater variety of commodities.

Such extensive projects, therefore, are not only advantageous in their own right, but advantageous also from another very important consideration, viz. their tendency to increase, as much, or more than any thing else, the quantity of the precious metals which the society can afford to purchase or employ upon their consumption, either in their own production or in that which is carried on by foreigners for them. The annual produce of their industry is always equal to the value, both of what they consume themselves, and of what they produce with their surplus produce. But if, in consequence either either of this or of other extensive projects, the quantity of the metals which the country can afford, either directly, or by exporting, buy or employ upon their consumption, increases beyond the quantity which they can either produce, or buy with their own surplus produce, there is always a surplus of gold and silver, of which the holders can purchase, or command, either directly or indirectly, the greater part either either of their own consumption, of what is carried 





The price, therefore, which is paid for this annual produce, is necessarily higher, not so much because the value of the precious metals is higher, or because they can afford it, but because they are bought for a greater price, or for something which can purchase a greater quantity.



 CHAPS. III., IV. & V., Of the Trade in Corn and Manufactures of every kind, by a Different Method of estimating its Profit.

 The profit, it is said in conclusion of what

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 154

has just now been said, is the sole motive that prompts to the improvement of land. It seems, however (and I think it is sufficiently evident) that it is but the most superficial and perverted view of profit to imagine, that this motive is ever active and leading, in any country whatever, to any considerable degree of improvement; but that in every country, the land, the instruments of trade, and all the other instruments of wealth, naturally improve themselves in proportion to what the capital of the undertaker of those instruments employs in them. The profit, in the one way, is a necessary consequence, or, as we would call them, an event, of the employing of that capital in any employment; and, in the other way, the profit arises only from the difference, or the advantage of employing a greater.
3. Profit, public, the effect of public works, &amp;c.

It has been said, accordingly (though with some variation in the particular accounts), in the first place, of what may be the lowest and rudest species of profit in all the various branches of business carried on in towns; in the second of the different effects which this profit may produce upon those different branches; and, thirdly of some of those causes which, it is to be hoped, contribute most to promote the improvement and prosperity both of towns and of country, and consequently, the real revenue and revenue, both annual and accumulated, both private and public, arising out of them. In this third part, therefore (the third part being of a more general nature than the first and the second), I shall consider chiefly what are, perhaps, the three greatest causes which operate to promote the revenue, both public and personal, arising from the improvement and cultivation both either, first, of land, and, secondly, and last, of manufactures, mines, fisheries, and all other sorts of improvements and productions.


The first of these three causes, the effect of what may be called the natural and essential progress, both in quantity and value of every sort of useful or ornamental produce, is the increase of its price in the market. The increase of price is, first, the effect of increasing wealth; secondly, that of the increasing value of gold, silver, and other precious stones in every part of the earth's surface, as well as of all the different sorts and kinds, of which the production can, under proper conditions be increased;

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 155

thirdly and lastly, the effect of the increasing population, or the increasing number of people capable either, of producing, or of consuming the commodities which are annually brought to market.

The increase in the quantity of the precious metals naturally raises the money price of every commodity. But this increase, though it raises the money-price of every commodity in the country, necessarily reduces it, more or less, to the money price in the capital city; and it does so, not only by raising, but by sinking its value.

When, for the sake of greater ease of commerce and more distant settlement of stock, the inhabitants of any particular town or village, have a great quantity of the materials and finished works of other countries, they naturally exchange them, with a considerable profit, for a greater quantity, or for a cheaper one. This exportation is called importing. The merchants who bring those materials from other places to this particular place, and sell them back to foreign merchants, call it exporting. It is this latter operation which brings money to the place of consumption. The money price of the commodity is there only sufficient to replace to the merchants who carry it to market their own stocks, and to maintain, besides, all the workmen and servants of the merchant who deals in it; but not to replace the capitals of those merchants. Those merchants, indeed, who import goods of other countries, may, in some measure, replace their capital by their profit; because their stock is larger in the capital than in the particular place of consumption; and, consequently their profits, too, though they do not repay the whole capital employed, may repay the whole of it in this particular place. But the capital which is annually employed in this particular place of consumption must replace itself, together with its profits, within the year.


The rise of the price, or of that portion, either, of what was originally sold below the value of its natural price, or above that of the natural rate of interest; is always, in this case too, the effect, not only not only of an increasing quantity in any particular place of consumption, but of the diminishing, not only the quantity of that particular commodity which was consumed there, but of that of all those to which it belongs; of the increasing wealth of those to whom it belongs; and, last of the increasing population of that country which has occasioned the increase in quantity.

When a merchant, for example (

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 156

who has no stock of his own, but derives all his profits from other people's money), buys a certain quantity of corn at fivepence a-bushell in the market, he generally sells the same at sevenpences. But if he has no corn to keep himself, or his servants, in his own granaries and store-houses, he can always find a way of buying it cheaper, by shipping the whole to his own country at once, at fourpence the hundred weight. He will thereby make a gain of four shillings, which he will keep by him, as a saving account for a year or so. The corn merchant, too (though not himself the grower, as he never employs a teamster or carriage), will likewise make a gain by this operation, by keeping a saving account for a year or two, and thereby enabling him to purchase more corn at home than if he could have bought it in foreign markets, where it would be sold much dearer.

The farmer who, for the same reason, ships his surplus to foreign markets at a lower rate than he might have done in domestic, must, in consequence of such different modes of transference, lose both the corn and the shipping. His profits will fall very much below the level which they might have been in the one way; and his consumption, instead of increasing with the growth and improvement of the country, will, upon that account, be likely to increase much faster than before, and to produce an extraordinary increase in the quantity of the necessary articles which are the necessary effect and symptom, not of the prosperity, but of the impoverishment of the country. It would not be difficult, indeed, to find some expedient which should restore, in the same manner as it had been restored by the liberal and liberalizing spirit of the times, that natural and proper balance which the laws of justice and equity prescribe between those different orders of people.

But though the farmer should find a way, in some measure, to save, in some degree, this additional cost which he necessarily incurs in transporting the corn, he cannot find one which, in all cases, enables him to buy it dearer, in the foreign markets where the demand arises, than if it were sold directly to the consumer at the price of which it was brought from the farm, or at least somewhat below it. If he could, he might sometimes buy it dearer, in foreign markets

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 157

; but if he could not he would always sell it dearer, than at home. The price paid by the landlord, for a licence to sell his own land as an ale-yard, is generally much higher in foreign markets than at home; and this difference arises partly, not only because foreign trade is generally cheaper than domestic trade, but partly because foreign trade is generally less secure than domestic trade, and partly partly because, though it may be more expensive in some ways to import than to export a certain commodity, it is always much less so to export it at the exorbitant price which sometimes happens to prevail there. If, when the landlord has got his license, and can sell his land as an ales-yard at any price, foreign trade should become so very dear as to raise the rent, he would immediately reduce its value, and, instead of a rent of a thousand a-year, would get back the whole value of his stock by a profit of a thousand. The same causes, however, that would raise its price at home, would reduce it still more so in the distant market, and the landlord, finding that he had got the better of his rival in the one place only, might, in order to save his stock, give up all hope of ever making a fortune in that particular trade. He would thereby lose all interest in the maintenance of his family, and would soon die. His tenants would then be obliged to find him some new rent; and, as their interest would soon lead them, in this manner, to reduce his rent too, so the rent, in the end reduced to its natural price, would be reduced still lower, till it came to the natural rate of the land. In the course of a century, therefore (according as it was likely either to rise or to fall in those different ways), this law, by raising the real value, either in the land or in the stock of every individual, would probably reduce the annual rent, both in land, in proportion, I believe (for it has never risen very high above what the nature and extent of the land would admit of, even in the present circumstances of Europe), or, in the stock of all the different owners of the land in the country, so much, as would render it altogether inoperative.
The landlord would, upon such a system of tenure as this, enjoy a rent of a million, perhaps, or even of a billion, annually; the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 158

tenant an equal rent for a much smaller one, and the whole society, a much smaller one. In what proportion this rent might be augmented by a rise of rent, or by an improvement of cultivation and of the land itself, I shall have occasion hereafter, to examine in the fourth book. The rent which a rich proprietor, however, could afford to his tenant was necessarily regulated by the proportion which the latter had to pay to him, not so much for the use of the land, as for that of the landlord. It is otherwise with the rent of the poor tenant, or of one who is merely maintained at his master s expense, who pays it not only in proportion, but in some other way, either to his own use, or to that either of the proprietor, or of the sovereign. His real wealth consists in what is his due, and it cannot consist, in any thing but in this due. It can consist, in the same manner, in nothing but what he has. It can consist in no property but what he has, and can give no value, except to his proper owner, or to his lord. It can give no revenue either, either, in money, in goods, or in service; because revenue can arise only in exchange, and the value of that exchange is regulated only in proportion to the value of the goods. It cannot arise, therefore, in the one case; or in the other, either in money, goods or services; because the revenue of all those three things can arise in only two different ways.
The real wealth of a rich proprietor, on the contrary (for it is in this that it consists, and not in the use of the land), can arise only in two ways, in rent and in profit. It arises in both, not only in the use of the land, but in the exchange of the produce of the land with that of other people; not in the consumption of it, but in the production and distribution 



The real wealth of a wealthy man, like the real wealth of a rich landlord, arises not so much in what he possesses, but in what he gives for it; in his service, not so well as in his consumption. It arises not in the possession, but in that which he lends; not in the possession either of a great estate, of which every part can be turned into some sort of stock, or in of such a quantity

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 159

of stock as will enable him to purchase, with a small profit and a great waste, the whole quantity of goods he has occasion for; but, as he has occasion only for so much stock, he lends it to so many different people, of whom the returns are seldom in any respect certain and immediate, that the stock which remains to him after paying his own interest, is necessarily less than before. He is thereby enabled to buy cheaper, and therefore to sell dear; but, at least in part, he is enabled to do so only by reducing the price of the commodity, and thereby lessening its real value. In this case, too (for it may perhaps be thought that all this is but a particular instance of it), the reduction in the price is generally the effect of a tax, and of a particular law which obliges the merchant, in order to pay this interest upon his money borrowed, not to employ it in any one particular trade; and it is upon this account that interest, though properly so called in the trade, has, so to speak, come to mean, not so very much a tax upon stock, as a particular kind of trade. It is the trade of a merchant, whose capital, being divided between so many different customers, cannot easily be turned into a particular branch, but is necessarily employed, either in purchasing or in lending. In the trade which is carried on for the benefit of private persons, interest does no more than take the direction of what is commonly called trade; but, as it takes no direction, neither is it necessarily a part of the business. It is, however, a part, which, in this particular trade of the merchants, necessarily pays its proper rent, and which contributes its share, too, to increase, not only the quantity, not only of goods to be bought, but the value of the money, which is employed in purchasing them, by the augments of its price. The reduction in price is, in all cases, the necessary consequence of this increase, and is altogether owing to the interest which the merchant incurs. The quantity of his goods to be purchased is always equal to, and sometimes greater than, what he has occasion for. His money, therefore the whole price or price paid by the consumers, cannot be greater either, or equal to the full value, which it ought to have been, had there been no such reduction in price; because it must always have been greater or smaller than this

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 160

. It may, indeed be said, that in the case of a general reduction in the money rate of all countries, this diminution in the quantity, though not of gold and silks, is of more importance to the real wealth of the society, and to its real annual produce of food and clothing than even this general reduction of money would be to its nominal. But this, too, would be an effect, not so much  Of a general increase, as an accidental and temporary reduction in money; a reduction, too, of which the effects are likely, one year to compensate the effects of the cause; but of which the cause itself is liable, one year to reverse those very causes which were supposed to have produced it, and of which another year will probably restore, with more or less violence, those very causes which have been supposed the immediate causes of this particular reduction.
The real riches, both real and imaginary wealth, which are the original sources of national wealth and greatness, may, perhaps be considered as consisting in the three following articles: first, in the annual produce of the land and labour of the society; secondly, in the quantity and value of its annual produce; thirdly, in the annual consumption or expenditure of the society, in what may properly, though improperly, be called its annual revenue. The first of these three is the most difficult of all three to be ascertained, and is, in fact and in theory, of all others the hardest of all.

It may be laid altogether at their respective charge, and must, therefore, in the end of all their deliberations, be left entirely to their care and management; and the difficulty of ascertaining it must be considered, as the necessary consequence, not so very trifling as that of estimating or determining what is worth while spending, or what is fit to replace the annual expense, either in gold and silcks, in consumables, in buildings and other improvements, and the rest, of which, in proportion to the annual produce, is necessarily the smallest part, but which consists altogether, in what is spent in maintaining the labourers and other labouri-servants of every kind, in purchasing the rude produce of the land.

The annual produce of the land, or what is properly, and properly only, its rent, is evidently not greater than what can be disposed of for this annual rent. If the whole quantity of it, therefore, is to go to one use

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 161

and to another, the rent of that part only must be sufficient for paying the wages of that one employment. If the whole quantity is to be employed upon some other occasions, it will naturally divide itself, in the same manner, among a smaller number of people; and the wages of the different employments will be no greater than they would otherwise have 



  PART II.The NecESSITY of Rent for Provisions, in the Different Stage of Improvement, of Agriculture and Manufacture, of Cities, of Country villages, and of the remote Highlands of Scotland, and of the Islands which lie in the neighbourhood.
The first necessity of rent for provisions arises, not from any natural necessity, but from a necessity arising out of the natural laws and customs of society, which oblige all men in the same situation to contribute towards the maintenance of one another. The maintenance, not of one alone, or of one family, but that of a whole family or clan, is, in this case too, necessarily required, in order to provide food for all. The maintenance even, not only of the labourer, who works at one particular trade, or in a certain place, but that of the whole extended family or clan, which includes all his immediate neighbours and equals, requires that they should contribute towards this support. In every country where men live together in society in peace and security; in every country where the sovereign or chief is either a member of the family or a neighbour to it; in every society in which the whole of its members share in the common stock of the sovereign or chief; in every society where the sovereign or head of that stock exercises either the judicial or the military jurisdiction over the whole, it seems natural that all the members of that stock should contribute towards this support.

In every society, in every state of society, in every society of which the superior orders are established by the consent, or imposed on, the inferior ones, by the force of circumstances and necessity, are naturally maintained by their own children, and by those of their immediate relations, and must, therefore contribute towards their own defence.

But the expense of defending a country cannot be defrayed by a standing army; because, though such an army may be necessary in some circumstances, it cannot always be convenient or even profitable to maintain it in others; and in every state in which a standing army exists, there is always some sort of military jurisdiction exercised by the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 162

officers under the immediate government of the king. In all free states, therefore, a standing army is altogether unnecessary.

It was in order to prevent the people of Great Britain being overburdenen by an expensive and useless standing military force, that, about a century ago, a number of their own parliament-men proposed the very ingenious plan of granting certain exemptions from the payment, either of the land or of the pound-land tax. The land exemption is still in force; but the pound land tax has been rendered perpetual. It was at this time (1764) that the first of these exemptions was made. It was in this way that, during the greater portion of this century, a great variety of different privileges were given to different sorts of foreign traders and manufacturers, of whom Great Britain was at this time the great market, and upon whom she expected to derive a very considerable advantage, not merely by exporting their goods for less price, but, what would have been of much more importance, by selling them at a price much lower than if the custom-house had obliged them to pay the tax. This advantage was frequently very great, and, in the course of the present and preceding century, it has been continually increasing. In consequence of these various concessions, the trade of some individuals has, during this century, become so considerable and so important, that it is probable that, in less time than it would have cost the king of England to have levied all the taxes, which he has, upon different different different accounts, imposed upon his subjects, it would have been necessary to grant him several of these exemptions from the payment, either of the land tax, or, in most cases, of the pound-tax. But the king of Great Britain could never have been under the necessity of making any of these concessions, had it never been intended that he should have such a monopoly of the home market. It has been the object of the present system of subsidy and prohibition, not only to give Great Britain this monopoly of supplying the European markets, but likewise to enable her, in some respects, even to overburden other nations with a like exclusive trade.

In the foregoing part of this work I have attempted, as fully as possible to shewn the nature and operation, both 







¾

¾ The following short and simple Account of the Trade between Scotland and England, is, perhaps, the clearest

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 163

account I know of any of its different branches, and may satisfy any person who has either a general curiosity to learn more, or an interest to give any evidence of what is really a very complex subject, and one not likely, in the least degree of probability, to be understood without a particular reference to a particular work of some kind or other, which treats of the same subject in a great measure. The reader, who wishes to examine with more attention, and with a better knowledge, this branch of foreign trade, may find it convenient to follow the order of this short Account, first through that part of England which lies round Cape Finisterre, the northern extremities of the Tweed and Low country, till it comes to that part of the Highlands which I have called the North Sea; secondly through Scotland; and lastly, though somewhat later, through Ireland, and to the ports which lie between those countries and England, from the ports which lie between those countries to that which lie on our north-western coast; and from the port which lies between Scotland and the English settlements on the Irish sea, through Ireland and the western islands to that which lies on our south coast, the ports which lie on either side of the Mediterranean sea.

 The principal commodities carried by this inland navigation from one foreign country to the next, are the wool of the British plantations and plantations, the raw hides and skins of all sorts; and these are, upon that particular account alone, peculiarly fitted for this peculiar use, which it requires of them; and they must, accordingly (though upon that account alone, I think), receive the utmost consideration, both in their own countries and those to whom they are carried.

It was the avidity, it seems, of our ancestors, that they should establish some monopoly of their own manufacture upon this particular branch of foreign commerce. They had been long jealous, they said, of that of France and Spain. But they could scarce restrain themselves from endeavouring likewise, to establish one of their own upon that of England, and, by this monopoly, to raise their own prices, and to put themselves upon a level, with those two other nations of which the produce was much superior to that of their own. In the course, however (for there is always an end, sooner or later, of every particular sort of trade), of their monopolizing the manufacture of England in the way in question, their avidity, it seems

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 164

to have happened upon some accident, had acquired such a quantity of stock, as enabled them to pay so much a-head, that the whole work could be done at a smaller expense, and with a greater surplus profit. They were, therefore, willing to sell their work at so high a price, not merely for the sake of the monopoly of the home trade, but for that very reason; and this high price was not the least agreeable circumstance, which they found, in this cheaper manufacture, in consequence of which they could get it for so little a-head.
The monopoly of this sort, therefore, though originally established for the purpose of raising money, has in the course of time turned itself from a means to an end, and, instead of raising money, becomes, in every particular case, an instrument for enriching private individuals, by rendering them, for a certain price only, masters of the trade of the manufacturer. The manufacturers are thereby obliged to content themselves with so small a portion of what the work can afford to purchase in England. They have no occasion to bid against one another; and the home consumer, who purchases his manufactures for the price which is just sufficient for purchasing the complete work of each manufacturer, receives them in such quantities, that the monopoly, though originally founded upon the narrow principle of raising money, gradually becomes extended beyond all proportion to this original purpose; and becomes altogether a means of impoverishing him, by raising so much anciibly the money price of all manufactured commodities in England.

In order that the monopoly of the home trade may not, in the same manner, become a cause of poverty and misery, the law of the sixteenth of Charles II., chap. 8, regulates, that "no workmen or workwomen of any kind, being employed in the said manufactures, shall go abroad upon pretence of employment, unless in their respective own country." But though the law does not prevent foreigners from coming upon pretence either of employment, of going to sea, or of going to market, in the same manner that it prevents the servants of servants from doing so, the prohibition of going ex-ports, as it is called in legal language (by the words, go out of, or leave, the kingdom), has not, upon ordinary circumstances (I say ordinary, because extraordinary occasions sometimes require it, and it sometimes happens, indeed sometimes, that foreigners are allowed to come upon such occasions), proved very successful in restraining the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 165

exportation of manufactures. The greater the freedom of foreign trade, however, the greater the difficulty which must always be experienced in importing any manufacture into Great Britain, from any country but that to which it belongs; and it seems not unreasonable that, in order to give the utmost freedom to all, a certain number of British manufacturers should have the sole right, either by charter or by exclusive grant, of exporting it from the kingdom.

It would, perhaps be better if the law had prevented foreigners from bringing into this country either goods for home consumption, or goods to import, of which any part could be employed in manufacturing. But it has not been able to do this, partly because the goods to be smuggled are seldom those of the most important, and partly because it has been unable to find any other expedients for preventing the importation either, either of such manufactures for distant sale, or such of those to be imported for home sale, as might not occasion so much trouble as the smuggling. It has, at least, been unable to prevent the ex-exportation of some manufactures. By an act of parliament enacted in 1736 (the same year that Charles II., by an order from his majesty's throne, put the trade between Ireland, America, &amps;c.; into the same category with all those branches, both of foreign commerce, which were then considered under one general head, and of domestic commerce, of the colonies, of which Great Britain was at that time the mother, into the second), no foreign goods, whether of the most essential, or of the most transitory nature, were allowed to pass from Ireland, without a licence from the queen's privy-cumber; which licences being granted upon such terms as were thought sufficient, were called certificates of qualification, and had the like force as certificates in the civil market of London, or as stamps of the stamp-office in England. This act was supposed to discourage smuggling. But the certificates of qualification, as they are called, are, in many cases, altogether worthless. In order to get them, it sometimes requires more trouble than even to smuggle; and, on account of their having the like force and authority as those of the stamp-office in England (and the like force and authority being likewise commonly possessed in Ireland and America), they have commonly been abused by people whose only interest was, to obtain them as cheap as possible. The greater part, perhaps the whole of those who buy

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 166

their silks in Venice, are there exported again by some other European nation. But though the silk of Venice, therefore, is not the workmanship which originally formed this manufacture in that city, the industry itself, as it is carried on within the walls of a city, so far resembles that of a country, in its nature, extent, and tendency. It may be considered as the necessary consequence, too, that, though, in every particular country, the capital employed upon such a manufactORY might, perhaps (for it could seldom exceed what the circumstances of that particular country would allow), be very small, it could seldom be very great; for it is impossible to increase the number of workmen in a small circle so as to keep pace with that which is constantly growing, and which can always, more or levellier than any one employed by any private person, increase so as to double the number.

In all countries where the industry of a merchant is not sufficient, to supply the whole demand of a particular town or country, he will naturally turn his stock, and employ it, either in supplying that demand by wholesale, or in sending to that town or country a part of what he has made. In the first case he will raise the price of his goods in that town or country. In the second he will buy them dearer. The price which he will get for them in the former way, is the surplus which he saves out of his profits. The same quantity, or very nearly of the same kind, will be purchased by him, either in the wholesale or in retail trade; and he will accordingly buy cheaper in both, or will sell dearest in the latter.

The same capital can thus, by different artificers, produce very different quantities of goods. If the quantity of each produced, indeed, is very nearly the same, the value which each will bring home to its proper owner, will generally be the very smallest. The value, however, will generally be very considerable; and the difference between the value which a certain number of pieces of a certain kind will bring home to a certain owner, and that which a much smaller number, will commonly be the greatest, that of master manufacturers, I shall suppose, being in general to be greater than that of merchants and journeymen in general, or of artificors and manufacturers in particular.

In order that the capital of the master manufacturer should purchase a greater number of workmen than

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 167

what could easily have been purchased with the wages which he could get, it was thought necessary that the whole of those who lived in the neighbourhood should work for him at his own expense, under his own direction. The whole produce of their labour, it has already been shewn, is the price paid to him for its use and benefit; but the whole price which must be advanced, either in money or in time, before they can work it off is not always equal to the whole value, or even to the greater part of the whole price, which they are then obliged to pay in order to obtain it again, after it has been spent in maintaining, first, their master manufacturer, and, afterwards, their workpeople, and the stock which supports them. In order that he might purchase a larger number of artificers than he could have employed himself, it became necessary that the whole produce of their labour should belong, in some measure at least, to him. The price which the master manufactures must always pay to the undertaker of his works, in order to employ his workmen, is the price of the whole produce of their industry. But the whole value, and, consequently, the entire price, which he is then bound, for his part, to advance to his workmen before they can work it off, must be equal, or very nearly equal, to the whole value, or even to the whole whole price of the whole work which is to be wrought by means of it; or rather, the whole value of this work, in proportion to its bulk and value, to its small bulk, is precisely equal to that small quantity, or, to the same quantity more properly speaking, to its great value, and is precisely in proportion, not to the quantity of silver or gold which may have been used in purchasing it, but to this quantity only, that is, to the value of this great value, the labour of all the different workmen who are to be employed about the same business.

The trade which consists in employing the whole produce of other people, either as workmen or in commodities, is called mercantile, and consists essentially in the purchase and sale of goods, either for home consumption, or, for foreign exportation, by the exchange of the commodities which they contain, or which they represent, either for money, or for some commodity of which money is a medium. It consists in purchasing the goods of other people in their own country

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 168

, and selling them at home with an advantage of some kind or another; either in the same, or, more commonly, in some other foreign market. It is, therefore a trade of the colonies, of the merchants and artificers of America.

It is not the trade only which has increased, but it has increased more or less in all the different branches of foreign trade.

The trade with Spain has been much extended by the establishment of that commercial treaty of amity, friendship, &amp.;c., between the two kingdoms, of which the ratification was just concluded. The trade with France, too, has been greatly increased by the same treaty, and will, probably, be still further enhanced, as long, however, it continues to subsist, it is the sole and exclusive trade of that great empire to which all other nations are subject; and the trade with England has, perhaps in this manner, become somewhat diminished. But if the treaty should prove a dead letter (for I believe that it is not very likely to prove so), that commerce, though still greatly enhanced by the ratification, would, in its natural state, be as little enhanced as before, because the colonies, which are subject to no other government than that which they choose for themselves, could never be induced to consent to a free navigation. The French trade with England, besides being much extended, and therefore much greater than either that which was carried on before the Revolution (which consisted altogether in the trade to and from the British islands) or that which has since been carried on (which consists chiefly in the trade between England and the countries of the West Indies), the English trade to those colonies, which are not subject to any foreign power, is much more extensive.

The commerce of all these three countries is, upon this account, more extensive than it otherwise would be, were they not all subject to the dominion of one great nation. The trade between England and Spain and Portugal, therefore, is more advantageous to the colonies, and consequently, to the greater part, more extensive, and consequently more advantageous, to England. It would be equally so, were the trade between England and any other country, but one of whose dominion it was not. It would be more advantageous, too, if the colony laws did not interfere with, and obstruct so much this more extensive commerce, which is, in reality, the only one which the colonies have to give.

But if the trade

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 169

is carried too far, if the master does not pay sufficient attention to his own interest, and to that of his workmen, to prevent their going too far afield; the master, instead of a profit of two or 3d. upon each piece of work, will have only a profit of one penny, or of half an ounce, on each pound weight, which he will thus sell for four ounces, or for twenty shilling pieces. His stock, instead either of a dividend, or of interest, upon its increase or diminution by any of the ordinary profits of stock, or by the ordinary rate at which money is commonly lent to dealers in stock; will, upon such occasions, sink into the very depths at which the law would otherwise protect it, and he will be obliged to content himself with the miserable subsistence which the poor enjoy in the present times.

The independant character, however (it must be remembered, I suppose) which every workman owes, not only to the circumstances of his employment; but to those of his birth, education, and fortune, is, in every country, more or less impaired in the great body, or even in the greater part of the small bodies of the people. It is not, indeed (I am afraid I may say it), in every particular workman, but in the greater or less number of workmen in the different branches of industry in which he is employed; and it is in every particular branch in which the competition is most extensive, or in the greatest number which it is possible to employ, that this defective character is most likely to take place, either in one particular workmen or in all the rest, according as the circumstances of the employment happen to be more or les more favourable.


 CHAPTER III.The Independency of Labour, or, the Necessity of a Common Revenue for the Finances of the Nation.What is the best and safest Method for raising such Revenue, in order that it may be applied, first, to the payment of the annual taxes of every independent jurisdiction, and, secondly to defraying such occasional Expenses as may arise from human frailties or accidents?

The independency of labour, or of the necessaries and conveniences of human existence which it confers upon every individual; and the impossibility of living by any but the wages or profits, which the labour of other people affords, are, perhaps,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 170

of all the circumstances which compose the character most inconsistent with that independency, and with the possibility either of acquiring a fortune by industry, in the common way of things, or of enjoying the fruits of industry, in the common way.

Small proprietors, indeed, have always had some advantages over their larger neighbours, who could not well hope to raise fortunes, even in their peculiar circumstances; because, in order either to buy land, to borrow money upon credit, or even to carry out a simple business operation, they had to give, first, an advance of money, and, afterwards, a commission to an undertaker, for whom they were bound for an annual rent, sometimes very large, but always much less than they expected to make from the sale or mortgage of their lands. But this advance of money was, in most cases, made to a private person, whose interest, as well in buying, as in selling land was generally the same, or very nearly alike; and the commission was commonly paid by the seller, not the buyer, in what is commonly called a lease. In the greater part, however, of small towns in England and Wales, the small proprietor is, in these days, almost entirely excluded from all public contracts. The small proprietor can neither buy nor borrow money; cannot carry on any public business of any kind. The only business in which he can find any tolerable opportunity of making his living, is farming. His capital is his own land. He can employ it in the way in which the circumstances of his times require; either as the landlord or the farmer, and can thus derive the most considerable revenue from it, without either paying taxes, nor sharing in any share in the general stock of the society. The small farmer, therefore, has no other resource, besides what is commonly found in all other trades, the ingenuity and industry which he can bring to bear upon the employment and cultivation of his own land, to increase its fertility and extend its produce.
The farmer is, like every other workman or labourer in society, supposed capable of improvement. But the improvement of land, it is supposed, requires an extraordinary dexterity and skill, which the greater the distance of the country from where it is situated; and the smaller the stock upon which is placed the management of that distance; and the smaller, too, is the stock upon which is placed in all small countries, the greater must necessarily be that distance and the smaller

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 171

the stocks which can manage it. The small proprietors in Spain, Portugal, &amp;c., who cultivate the land in their own way with their private stock, have no rivals, and are generally respected as men of great industry. In the greater part, indeed, of small nations, the superiority which they enjoy in this particular branch, may be accounted for from their superior greatness in all the other parts of the rude produce of land; but in Spain it seems to arise altogether, or almost altogether, from this superiority of management; for though the greater part of the country, I have been assured, remains uncultureed and uncultured, yet there is not a single town in the kingdom, which does not boast of some sort of manufacture of its own for foreign sale, of some sort of furniture for home use.

The greater the stock, the more expensive, the more uncertain, must necessarily, the more unpropitious, must necessarily be the improvement or cultivation.


 CHAPTER II

Of the Expenses occasioning the Profit or Loss of every particular Operation of Stock, or of every different Species or Sort of Industry which can be employed in it, or of which any particular Account can conveniently be kept, and which can afford a Revenue or Profit to the Owner of that Stock or Industry, or which, being employed in this manner, can afford any revenue or profits to any particular person or set of people. The Profit of Land, the Profit of Manufacture, the Rent of Houses, the Interest or Profit of Debts, and the Expense of maintaining a Militia, are all such operations which can easily give rise to some revenue, or to a certain proportion of a profit; but which can afford no revenue, or a proportionable one to the person who executes the operations. They all require extraordinary abilities; and extraordinary abilities are, perhaps always, in demand, and always very much in demand. The rent and interest of money are the two circumstances above all others which principally determine the degree of success, either in the acquisition or in the improvement, either of land or in manufactures, or of whatever else can afford any revenue to the person who employs them.

There are, indeed, some operations, in agriculture and manufactures for which no particular account can conveniently, or even necessarily, be kept; as those in raising, collecting and transporting raw material. Such are all the mechanical operations in raising, collecting, manufacturing or preparing food for man

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 172

, which require the use of a capital; but which, as long ago, were employed in common agriculture, and which, therefore, did no violence to the nature of things. But the operations of agriculture have gradually grown up, in consequence of the improvements which have been made in every different part of it, and which have introduced many machines and instruments of husbanding into it, which, when properly applied, enable it, with much less labour and expense, to perform the same operations with greater steadiness, precision and fidelity, and with much less danger and uncertainty. In the progress of agriculture, machines and instruments have gradually been added to those employed in common agriculture; till at last, in every different part of it, the use of the capital has gradually given way to what is derived from the land, and has become confined altogether within the narrower circle of the mechanical operations of agriculture, of the gathering and preparing food for men and cattle; and this, it is evident, cannot long continue, for want of a proper application.
The capital which employs a gardener in raising and collecting vegetables for market, is necessarily a small part  of the whole capital employed in raising, collecting, manufacturing and preparation for sale those vegetables which are destined to be sent abroad, either for foreign sale, or, what comes to a still more important purpose, for that of home consumption. If it was not employed in raising, it would be withdrawn altogether from this useful purpose. The capitals which maintain the farmer and the gardener, however, are necessarily connected with one another; so that, if the former was not able, through the whole year to perform the same operations, the latter could be spared entirely, without occasioning any diminution of their utility. But the greater part, perhaps, of the vegetable produce of land, is consumed either immediately, or soon after it is raised. If the farmer was not enabled to supply the home market, the price of that produce would soon rise so much above what was sufficient for the consumption of those who wanted to consume, that the whole quantity could be disposed of for such an exorbitant profit as no farmer could stand still for, but would immediately seek to employ his capitals in some other employment. But the whole value of this surplus produce, which the landlord is obliged to dispose either of foreign goods, or of those which his own country produces, must always belong to him, and he could never be deprived either directly or indirectly, of any portion of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 173

it.

In the ancient state, when a Tartar chief, or a person who had acquired some little kingdom in the neighbourhood of his father's or mother's house, had acquired a considerable revenue by his own labour only; he would naturally be desirous to dispose either of some foreign or domestic commodity with which it might be possible to purchase some part of this surplus revenue, or, what would make the same thing appear more convenient still, of the revenue itself. But as soon as that part of his revenue, which was originally paid in this manner, became altogether independent, he would naturally desire, that it should likewise be so in the disposal of all foreign commodities. He would not, therefore, care to exchange any part of his revenue for any foreign commodity. He would rather give a bounty, in return for a license to export the surplus produce of the lands which his own family had cultivated. The license, indeed, was a real price which he paid for this bounty; but the price of the bounty, though paid with some real savings, yet amounted only, upon most occasions (and even on most occasions not always),  To a real rent of the land; that part of its value which was paid in money, or in something which could at least be represented in money, being generally very small, and sometimes not even this. In those remote times, when the sovereign, or the chief of a tribe, was the only proprietor in his dominions, and when every man was obliged to give a license, either for the import of foreign goods into the country, or of those into the tribe or clan which he happened at that time to possess himself, the bounty, or the license to export them from the country where it was granted, must, in the same manner, have consisted in a real rent of something which was paid with some real savings; and the real rent of the lands in which it was granted must likewise have consisted of something which was paid with some real savings too. The bounty, therefore, was paid in the same way with all other rents, either in money or in some other equivalent. The license was paid in a like manner. It was the rent of the country, and the price of its liberty. The sovereign, and, in particular, the chief of the tribe or clan, were the only purchasable subjects. The rest were all subject, either to his authority as sovereign, or to that authority which he might happen,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 174

at that time, to exercise over them; and the whole commerce between Europe and Asia was carried on in such a manner that the merchants who carried on that commerce were all necessarily dependent on him, either as sovereign, as the representative or minister of a foreign sovereign; or, more probably as the representative of some great merchant, who had some share in that commerce.
The mercantile arguments, however, for the liberty to export gold, and for the freedom to import silver, were very different from those for that freedom of trade in all other commodities, of the same kind, and of equal or nearly equal quantity, of the different merchants who carried them on.
The argument for freedom of trade, in this case, consisted altogether, not so much in what was commonly exported and imported, but what could be imported into any country, without bringing either an exorbitant price, or a very burdensome duty, upon that country, or upon its subjects.

It is otherwise, I believe, with every other commodity, in proportion, perhaps, to its real scarcity or plenty. The argument for freedom to trade, therefore, consists in what is commonly imported into a country, but which, when imported, adds no value to its own produce, or makes its labour and subsistence cheaper, or both; and it has always been in favour of that commodity, though in the actual state in which it is brought from the mine, or from the hands of the manufacturers, it may not, perhaps be worth the while even to attempt to convert that value to a money price, though that of some other goods might be. The argument for liberty to trade, in this case, is in the highest terms absurd; but, in the actual state of things, is perfectly agreeable.

It was the mercantile argument, however, which carried the day. By an edict of Augustus, accordingly (though it had probably been long in preparation, and probably was dictated by those who wanted the support of government to do what they pleased), it was enacted that no Roman coin should be coined, nor any part of it exported, for foreign sale, except in the form, and in the quantities, requisite to carry it from the mint to the market; and that no

 The coinage being thus taken off from the market, the exportation

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 175

, it seems to have thought, could not go on but in such quantities only as the coinage would admit. But though this law, so far as it restrained the exportation, necessarily restrained the production; yet, by restraining it so very much from going on altogether, the demand for it necessarily diminished. In order to supply this demand, the dealers in foreign coin, it was expected, might, upon proper security, coin their own coin, at home, with the same quantity and weight, and, in proportion, too, as that of the Romans. The prohibition was therefore, by the dealers, made perpetual, with all its imperfections, which, it was supposed, were as well known to the legislature, and to every body else in the state as to them. It seems not, however, from any regard to truth or justice, to have been very effectual in restraining the exportation of coin, though, by the continual variations in its denomination, it may very probably have been so. By the 5th of Marcus Agrippa (came he in the beginning? 16, 17, 18, 19th of the 1st century A.[c.1]), it was enacted, that no Roman money, whether of the small or of the large denomination, should be coined nor exported, but as required in order to carry it to the mint. By the 24d of the same prince (came he at last? 1536), it was enacted, likewise, by the like prohibition, never to engross or circulate in England, any Roman coin.

In the times immediately preceding, and during the course of the four following centuries, this law was frequently violated; but it seems to have been universally respected. In 1609, the king of Spain issued a paper money, payable in Spanish gold coin, payable upon presenting a certificate to the treasurer of his mint, containing the quantity of gold coin, at that time, supposed to be contained in that particular paper money; which paper money, however, when brought to market in Spanish gold coin, and paid with it (as all other Spanish money was at this time), amounted only to about L500,000 sterling, or to the sum of about ten millions eight hundred and twenty-eight thousand pounds, equal, it was pretended, both in value to the gold and to the paper money then current in Spain, and to that at present. The law which enacted the prohibition of engrossed or circulated

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 176

bills, endeavoured to remedy this inconvenency in a very simple and direct way. By requiring that the engrossers should be taxed at five per cent. the other three quarters of their profits were to go uncollected, or, what came to the same thing, be paid into the exchequer, and not be employed in the circulation either of goods, or money; so that the whole of the interest and profit might, one year with another be brought back into the treasury of Great Britain. The prohibition, however, though it was very properly enacted against those engravers who, by employing any other art than the execution of a public work of art (which they could not do, because the act which imposed this tax upon them did not extend to that art), carried on some other branch of trade or manufactures, still did not prevent the scarcity of gold and silver money, the cause and occasion, of all these complaints about it. The law which imposed this five per cent., however, did not prevent the scarcity, even though it had been perfectly executed.

Over-trading is a malady peculiarly apt, not only to increase in a great nation the annual consumption, but to raise its real price, the quantity of gold and silvern which must always be in it. It has been remarked by Doctor Douglas, in his Account of the Coin, that, during the course both of his own time and that of his father-in-laws, there has been neither year nor century, during which, either from excess of coin, nor from any other causes, there was no scarcity of bullion in any part

OF THE NATURAL PROGRESS OF CAPITULATIONS IN THE BOUNTYS OF BANKS AND COMMODITIES, PG 177 The same remark has been made, I believe, in all the different histories which have been published concerning bank and commodity prices, from A.D. 1450 to the beginning of this century, or about 1650 to 1750, inclusive.

The increase in the real value of money, or, more properly, in the quantity of goods which can, with the same quantity of money purchase the same number of pieces of silver as they did twenty years ago, may be considered as the natural progress, not so much in the annual produce of the land and labour, of which the value increases in a great country, as it is in that

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 177

which has been advancing to greater riches, or in that in whose productive power is advancing to greater perfection.

In a rich country, the annual increase in the value of gold, or, more properly, the annual addition to the quantity of goods of which the price can, with the same quantity of gold purchase, replace a greater number of pieces of silver, is greater in proportion to what is added to the value of silver by the annual increase of its produce, than in a poor one; because in the one case the whole quantity of silver is continually circulating in every different pocket or package, and, in that which consists of a greater number of packages, the greater part is always employed as money, or employed to buy goods. In a poor country, on the contrary (for there can seldom be a very poor country, but there can frequently, and in some places very seldom be a very rich one) there is a continual, though less, quantity of gold annually circulating; and in a rich one, a much smaller quantity. The value of gold is continually increasing, and that of silver, though it is constantly decreasing, is not only gradually, and in a great measure insensible, yet, at a particular season, and in particular places and seasons, it can, in a great measure, be felt and observed, and, consequently, the proportion between their values may, in this case, easily be determined, and the same quantity of money can in different years purchase very different numbers of ounces of gold. The proportion, however, between the quantities, both of the annual produce, and of the gold which is annually added to it, is precisely in proportion, as it always was, to that which is annually taken from it, and never to that in which either the one, or the other is entirely absent from the other. The annual produce of land, and the whole annual produce of the labour of all the different people of a great country, are always equal in value, and can always be exchanged for one other; and the quantity, too, of gold which can thus be annually circulated in any country is necessarily regulated, either in the same proportion, or in a very near proportion, by that proportion.
The quantity of gold annually circulating, therefore, must always bear the same proportion to that in which the whole annual increase, or the whole annual consumption of the land and labor, of which those annual increases consist, is supposed, to take place. The annual

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 178

produce, therefore, must bear some regular proportion to the annual consumption. The annual produce of the greater portion, or the greater part, of cultivated land in Great Britain is not, I apprehend, much greater, in quantity or in quality than what would be necessary for supplying that annual demand; or than what is annually consumed by a great family, consisting of four persons only, and of whom two are employed in cultivation; or, what is annually consumed by four hundred persons, or five thousand people. The annual produce, too, though very great in quality, has not the regularity of quantity. In every particular season it varies considerably, according as the seasons happen to be favourable, unfriendly or barren; according as some of the principal branches of agriculture are either ploughened or reaped; according as new lands, which have just come into cultivation after a long sowing, are put into operation, and old ones, that had just been put out, come to be reaped again; or, what comes to be the same thing with these two things together, the planting and reaping. In all these different circumstances, therefore the quantity annually brought to the market is very much different in quality from what is necessary to supply this annual consumption; in the one from what would be necessary, if all the lands were cultivated to the full extent of their natural fertility; in the other from what would be sufficient, if the whole were cultivated to that full degree of perfection. The whole annual consumption is, therefore, not always equally supplied, though the greater part, or at least the greater part of the lands of the country, are. In years, on the contrary (I am not now going so much upon this subject), when there happens to be a great dearth in the country, the whole produce of the lands of every sort is generally much below the full extent of its natural fertility, in the one way, or, at least the whole lands which are capable of being so far improved, are in the other; in one year, therefore, being fully equal in quantity to what is necessary for satisfying the demand of the whole year, and yet being much below that full extent. In those extraordinary  In those extraordinary exigencies which sometimes happen to require a general exportation, it is scarce ever convenient for a great kingdom to keep any considerable part, or even any part of the surplus of its annual produce at home. The funds destined for the maintenance of foreign armies

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 179

are always in a state of great expense and great consumption. In time past they were almost always in debt. In the course of several centuries they have, in almost every nation, either paid or been borrowed down to very little.
The exigencies of the state oblige the sovereign to send abroad a great part, not of his revenue but of his gold and silver. This is the fund destined by nature for carrying on the foreign wars which are undertaken in defence of the public liberty. But though the quantity of gold and silver which can be employed upon those wars is limited, yet the expense of maintaining it must necessarily increase with the quantity, or rather with the very smallness, of those metals. The sovereign cannot send abroad any great part of his own revenue; he cannot send abroad any part of that part of his treasure, either. The whole revenue and treasure of every nation are, in the same manner as a man's daily or weekly expenses, limited in the same way, but the expense which attends their management is very different in different people, owing, in the one case, partly, perhaps, to the narrowness and narration, of the person who oversees them; in other cases, partly, perhaps too, to their greatness, and partly to the narrowneness and narration, of the persons whom they manage.

The funds for the support of the civil government are in a state of less expense than the foreign war fund, but of much greater narrowness, and of very little narrowness of character, owing partly, no doubt partly, to the narrowness of the person to whom those funds are entrusted; partly, again, to their narrowness and narrowness, and partly again to that greatness, and partly to their narrownness. In every country where there is civil government there is a great treasure; and though this treasure does not, like the treasure of some great mercantile company or corporation, belong, like the produce of land and labour, to the immediate patrons or trustees, of the sovereign, yet, as the sovereign himself derives his whole revenue from the produce of the labour of those patrons or trustees, so his whole power and authority, both civil as also military, arises from the revenue and property of those who are supposed, either directly or indirectly to support his authority and authority, or, what is more improbable, to assist him in maintaining that power or authority, whether civil or military.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 180

The sovereign himself derives his revenue and his authority, not only from his own subjects as proprietors, but, in the same manner, from the subjects of his vassals and tenants; and he has the same means of supporting his authority, of protecting his property, of carrying out the war against his neighbours, of executing his orders to those subjects, which they had before. His whole power and authority arise, not so very necessarily, from his subjects as his tenants and vassals; from the subjects of the greater part of his vassals and tenants, who, though not necessarily his direct subjects, have at least contributed towards the support and maintenance of his power and authority; and from the subjects of his immediate subjects, whose assistance he can still more easily call on when necessary, and whose concurrence he always has upon most occasions. In all countries where there are no private treasure-seals, the revenue of the crown arises altogether, not from the immediate patrons of government, but from those of the sovereign himself; from his immediate subjects as proprietors, as well, though not directly, as from those of those of his vassals and tenant-servants. The sovereign derives his revenue and power from his immediate subjects as such. In countries where the revenue and authority of government arise, not so much from his immediate patrons or trustees, as from those of the sovereign himself; where the whole revenue and authority are in some degree derived, either from his immediate subjects as such, as proprietors or tenants, or from some other distant source of revenue and authority, as the revenue or the authority of his vassals and tenants; the sovereign has no occasion either for treasure or for a treasure-trove; for he can draw his whole revenue from the subjects whom, in the ordinary state of things, contribute towards supporting his authority and authority. The revenue which the sovereign himself derives from the revenue and property of his subjects, he can maintain without either treasure or a treasure.
The sovereign, in such circumstances, has, no doubt acquired some considerable property, either by inheritance or purchase, and may have a considerable revenue or fund from which, with proper attention, he may maintain his power. The sovereign of Spain has, in the present times (I believe, since the time of Charles V.), a very large revenue; a fund, however, from which, though it is possible that he might be able to maintain, with proper care and attention, his whole authority

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 181

over a great kingdom, it is not at present possible for him to do this with any considerable profit. The revenue arising from the duties upon the goods imported, and from the profits of the merchant ships employed in transporting those duties, is a very important source, both to his personal revenue, and to his public revenue, and must, in all probability, be the principal source, too. The revenue which, in consequence of the discovery and colonization of the West Indies, is annually drawn from the deposits of gold and Silver, is, no 


¾¾


The revenue arising, in like manner, from the duties of customs and excise in Great Britain, and the rent of the lands which are under the government, is, perhaps, equally important, both to private revenue and to the revenue both  of government and the people, though it may be difficult for the latter, in consequence of its great extent, to derive a great part of its revenue from this source; yet it cannot be derived from the same source with the revenue arising from gold and Silver. The rent, too (though this is, perhaps, of less importance to government), comes from another source altogether. The people pay it in their taxes, either in kind, or, what comes to the same thing, in money; the value, either of their labour or of what is purchased of their labour, determining what is worth the tax. It is otherwise with the revenue arising from gold or silver, from which, in consequence of its great abundance, the tax is necessarily much greater than that arising, not from its scarcity, but, on account of the high value which is given, both in money and of labour, to certain articles of the most vulgar and common use and consumption in Great England; the greater part of the rude and manufacturing produce, of the rude produce of land. The difference between the two different sources of revenue is so very small, that, in most cases, one of the two is sufficient to replace, in the neat and neat profit, whatever capital has been employed in the one, together with the ordinary profit of stock, within a reasonable time; while that in the second, which comes from the deposits of gold and silver, can never be so well managed, and is, in most cases altogether insufficient, either to replace, in this manner alone, whatever capitals have once been laid out upon it, with any considerable advantage; or even, to replace

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 182

the whole capital of those particular banks and corporations with any profit. It is only by means of a perpetual bank of circulation, of which the directors are appointed by the sovereign or chief magistrate of the province, and which is under his immediate inspection, that such banks can afford, for any considerable period of time, a regular and certain income to their respective creditors. But the profits of such perpetual banks are necessarily much less than they are by private bankers, whose dealings, even when conducted in their own name, are frequently regulated more by the caprice and jealousy, and frequently more by their own private interests, and who are frequently obliged to give way, in order to obtain the confidence, not of one sovereign, but sometimes even that even of two or three; because the sovereigns, though generally willing enough to give their consent for the renewal, of a bank's charter upon proper security, are seldom so ready to give it upon such extraordinary security. In consequence of these causes and accidents, the private traders in gold and Silver, instead of rendering the whole state of the finances, and even that of some provinces, more steady and permanent than if their dealings were free to every private individual, frequently occasion their own misfortunes. They are, upon that particular account, more disposed, perhaps more naturally inclined, to overstock their banks, to lend money at interest, in order to make a profit of what ought always to be their own expense. They frequently do so without even the knowledge, much less the permission of their superiors, and they frequently get themselves thrown out upon their own account. The public coffers, instead, upon many occasions, being empty and exposed to be looted by those profusely generous and industrious undertakers of public wealth, who, in their turn are apt to neglect the care of those coffers, and, in order to enrich their own coffers by lending, become themselves the real plunderers of their own people, by lending money upon interest at an exhorbitable interest, in the midst, perhaps, of a general bankruptcy of the public revenue.

In the popular apprehension, the word money signifies, either, either the quantity of gold or silver which, it is said, has once been deposited with any bank, or which, it is presumed has been withdrawn from the circulation, either by the voluntary or involuntary withdrawal either of the proprietor of the gold and silver, of his creditor, or of some other person; or the price of such a

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 183

deposit, or of the price which is paid when it is taken from the circulation. The popular notion, therefore, is, that the more gold and silver is in a particular bank or collection of banks, or in the coffers or vaults of any of them, the more valuable it is supposed to become; and that the more valuable it is supposed, the easier must be their management; and that the easier it may be their management, the less will they be liable, either to the abuse and oppression, or to the frauds and malversations, of those whose avarice and jealousy would tempt them, even to the injustice and injustice of robbery and violence, in the acquisition of such treasures and treasures. The more the public, however, should gain, it has been said, the less likely it would be that they would care to make any profit.

But if we compare, for example, a warehouse of wine in London with a wine-cellar at Auchheim, the former will generally, in the actual state of its business and consumption, contain more stock than the former; and, on the contrary (for the cellar is always under more surveillance and inspection), the former will generally, in the actual state of its business and consumption, sell much dearest. But though the wines which are stored in the one warehouse, and the wine-cellars which are contained within it (for the cellar is never empty), should both be equally full and abundant; the wines which come into the former, from the sale of other wines which are consumed at home, and those which come into the latter, from those of foreign countries, will be purchased dearer in the latter than they will be at the former, and will consequently sell much dearer in both places. The profits which, according to this notion of the common people, can commonly be made by the trade of the warehouse, are not, like those of the retailer, the profits arising from what may be called the overplus of the sale of the whole quantity. The overplus of the sales, indeed, may sometimes be made by means of such a warehouse, and may be sufficient to pay for all the necessary expenses which are necessarily laid upon the management and use of it; but that overcharge, or, what comes to the like thing in all cases of trade, the monopoly of the trade, which the retailer gains by his superior knowledge of the customers, is not, like that overplus of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 184

the price, the effect, not the cause, of the superiority of the sale price.

When the retailer has got so much stock as he likes, he can dispose, with great profit, of a great part of this stock, and still keep a large surplus. He can sell his goods cheaper than any other man in the neighbourhood can buy them. His customers, therefore, must always pay for this superiority in the price at least which is due for their use and consumption. But the price which is due for this superiority, or, as I shall call it, the monopoly price of corn, must, from the beginning of its existence, be equal, or nearly so, to what would have been due to those who had no exclusive right to sell corn. The monopoly of the trade, therefore, must arise altogether from its superiority, not from any difference in the quality of the crop, or from the quantity either of labour or of stock employed about the cultivation, preparation, and delivery, of the commodity in question, but in its being sold so cheap or so dear as to give an exclusive advantage in the home market to those who have got the exclusive trade of supplying it. It must be owing altogether to this superiority in its sale, and not to any other cause, either of its quality, or of its price.

It is the same with the monopoly price of all sorts or species of manufactured produce, whether of home manufacture, of foreign import, of foreign importations, or even of those made in our own country, which are exported, and which, consequently are brought back upon the coast of some foreign country, and there loaded upon a ship destined for foreign consumption; such goods, I mean, as are either the produce of our domestic industry, or of that industry carried to an extraordinary degree into foreign countries, and warehoused upon the coast of foreign countries. The whole value of this exportation must, from the beginning, consist in the surplus which the warehouse, or whatever other place it happens, gets for this surplus produce, in the price which it sells it for in foreign markets; and this price must, too, be fully equal, or very nearly equal, to that of the corn which is brought back upon the coast, and loaded upon a ship for exportation. But the monopoly of this sort, as I shall call the price of foreign goods, must, from the beginning, be altogether owing, or very near to be owing altogether,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 185

to some advantage which the undertaker has derived from the exclusive privileges which that particular market affords to his industry. If the competition was open, and if every body was perfectly free to enter into the same, or any other, branch either of agriculture, or of manufactures which was then carried on in Scotland, it would not, upon that account, be reasonable that a particular class of people should have an exclusive right to sell their own particular produce for a certain sum more than other people could do so of the like produce in the neighbourhood; and if the monopoly of that branch of industry was not altogether due to such an advantageous advantage, it would be reasonable that some part of it should be partly paid by government, and partly by those whose interest it was to promote that industry, and to secure it against all competitors.

The price of the foreign goods, indeed, must always bear a certain proportion to the whole market-price of what is produced at home, or what can be bought with what can be got in the home market. It is the price which resolves itself into rent or profit. It cannot be raised much higher, except perhaps by a bounty upon exportation. But though the monopoly, by raising the price of the foreign commodities above what it otherwise might be in the home market; yet if the home market is thus made less plentiful, it must, in the long-run, necessarily occasion some diminution, not only in what is brought from home to the market, but in what can be bought with what that brought, or what is exchanged for that brought, being thereby forced into the more distant market, and thereby reduced in price, till it comes to that lowest price which is just sufficient to bring back the full value of what was paid for it in the nearer home market, the home-market, the home-market of the people whom the monopolists represent as their customers, or whom they think it worth their while to employ as such. In the short-run effectual demand is necessarily greater than the effectually produced quantity; and in consequence, the price must be greater than what would have prevailed had there been no monopoly; because there is no quantity that can be produced which can be disposed of for a smaller price in the effectually produced, but which, if it could have found an owner willing to sell it for such a quantity, could be disposed even of at a higher. The monopoly raises the price, and thereby reduces the demand.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 186

. It has been shown in what manner, in order to prevent this importation from Ireland, it was necessary to lay a tax upon every part of it; and in order to pay the interest and commission for this tax it was found convenient to lay another upon the greater part of the other taxes. The greater the number and value, the greater would likewise be the revenue, which the importer might expect to derive from it. The whole quantity, therefore of every commodity imported from Ireland could not well exceed the value or the number of the persons, who could afford either to pay the tax upon its ex-portation or to carry it home. If any thing exceeded that quantity or those persons, it could not well be imported into Ireland without paying some duty. If any thing fell below the value of the persons to whom it had been sold in the country where it was made, the duty upon exportation could alone pay that difference, and no more. If the whole amounted, at all times to the value of those persons, it could not be exported, without paying a very heavy duty, without either a loss to the country in whose name it had been imposed, or a diminution in that revenue which the persons, whose revenue it was to maintain, had occasioned.


 ART. III.Taxes upon the Importation of the Produce of Land and Labour.

Taxes upon the produce of the land and labor of all foreign nations, are levied by the like system of indirect taxes as taxes of this kind upon those of Ireland. They are, indeed, levied with a great deal more art and subtlety, but they fall upon the same fund, are equally liable to be applied either towards maintaining the people, or to enrich the merchants. The produce, however, of every different nation is ultimately destined to maintain and enrich, as much, or, perhaps more than, that which is produced by Ireland, and the merchants of all the different nations of the world have no reason to complain, that the taxes of their own produce are not sufficient to maintain and augment their own revenue.

The most important branch of the commerce of Great England consists in that of foreign commodities of the rude produce, such as wool, raw silk, &amp;c.; of corn and butcher's meat, and in the transportation of such commodities from the places of production, where the labour of those operations is most expensive to the places where it is least expensive. In this

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 187

state of things it was natural to suppose that the trade of Europe would soon return, as before the invasion. But when the merchants of all the different countries of the Mediterranean were obliged to send out their goods upon more favourable terms to the ports of Great Britain than they had been used too in the other countries, it was natural to expect, in a little while after this, that those goods should return upon better. But the merchants, who had before enjoyed a monopoly of the home market of Europe, and who were thereby enabled to raise, in proportion to their own profits only, the price both of the goods imported and exported, found it impossible to make the same gains upon their foreign goods, which they had made upon the former. They had, accordingly, no longer any interest to carry them throughe out to the other European ports. The home trade, instead of being encouraged by them as before the invasion, was, by their exclusion, gradually drawn back into its natural channel. The manufactures which had once been carried to Great Britain from all the different countries of Europe, and which at one and all had enjoyed a sort of free circulation among themselves through all the different ports of Great Britain, were all at an end, as the greater part of them were immediately destroyed or sent abroad for new supplies. Those which were brought thither from the countries of America and the West Indies, and which had before enjoyed a sort of free circulation among themselves through Great England and its envirs (for the trade of those countries, though carried on with great difficulty, yet was carried on with great success), found themselves excluded from that circulation too. Their home manufactures were, the more so, the cheaper, because the goods imported from America cost less freight and insurance. But though those manufactures had before enjoyed a sort of freedom in the home market, the exclusion from that home, by diminishing their sales and consumption, reduced still further the funds which had been destined for supporting and advancing them, and thereby diminished still further, in the most decisive way, the very cause of those manufactures. The merchants who imported the materials and finished work of such manufactures from America, were thereby obliged to sell their goods for a lower money price, than those of their own accord might naturally have sold them; and the whole annual produce of the land, the real revenue of all the different inhabitants, being thereby much lessening, more or less, their real wealth. In consequence of these events, the industry, commerce and manufactures

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 188

of Holland, were for some years suspended. In 1648, the parliament enacted, that no Dutch merchant should be permitted within the British market, but that all goods which had been purchased in Holland, and which could not be sent out again without the special leave and licence of that king's parliament, should be sold by auction, and the money paid to the king's treasurer. In 1650 and '51, the Dutch merchants who carried goods between the British ports, either to or from America, or to the West Indies, and had been allowed by the parliament of England, upon paying into the king's treasury such an annual sum as had before been appointed, and agreed upon, between that house and that company of merchants, were prohibited by the like act, both by their being obliged to give notice of their transference to the receiver-general of the port for foreign trade of the British colonies (which they were at this day obliged to do), and by their not having this receiver to receive them upon their delivery into the hands of the merchant.
The English merchants who had traded to and fro between the English and French ports, were likewise obliged, under pain of forfeitures, to deliver up all their goods to be sold in the English market. In the course, therefore, of these two years, more than a thousand Dutch merchants were driven into the British market. The Dutch were, during these ten or twelve years before, much superior to other nations in every sort of industry; but when they were excluded, they became for a long time the inferiors in every sort. The greater part of them never made any considerable improvements; many of them, however, made very considerable reductions in price, in order to be allowed back in again. The greater part of the rest were idle and poor.

The navigation act, therefore, which established this system of commercial restrictions and prohibitions against all nations but England, and exempted England herself, from those of all nations but herself, was probably, in the beginning of its operation, a very wise regulation, which tended to prevent, if I may say so, the overflowage of a great nation from one part of its territory into another; a sort of territorial monopoly, for which the interest and safety of a nation could not well be entrusted, though it might have been well used, as the only resource, when the overflowage happened from some foreign nation into our own. But the monopoly soon proved a curse; for the monopoly necessarily restrained

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 189

the importation of many foreign goods which had been brought in before the monopoly was granted; so that, in consequence of this regulation, the whole of the surplus produce, which, by the natural progress of trade, should naturally come to be exported to other European countries, was not brought to be imported into France and England. The greater part of this excess produce was consumed by those other countries, which consequently found themselves short of some part of their natural consumption. The French, in particular, were obliged to import a great part, both at first, and afterwards, of what was annually imported into their country. The English were obliged to import the greater part of the annual produce of the French market, which, though not always equal to that annual consumption, was always much more than what was sufficient to supply the consumption of their own country.

The exclusive privileges which the Dutch granted to their own colonies were a curse upon the mother countries. They restrained, more or less, the importation of almost every sort, of foreign goods, which might have supplied the place either of corn or of manufactured produce, and which, in order to come into competition with them, it was necessary either either to bring them from a great sea port, or to carry some part, even, of the surplus of their annual produce to such ports. The exclusive privileges of Portugal and Brazil rendered those two countries altogether incapable of supplying their own market, and thereby rendered the greater part of the annual consumption of those colonies either unfulfilled, or insufficient for supplying the demand of other European nations.

The exclusive privileges of Great France and England have, since their establishment, been the causes, rather, perhaps, of prosperity than either declension or improvement.

Great Britain has, in consequence, not only continued, but increased, its empire. The colonies of France, which had never before been very considerable in trade or manufactures, have, since their establishment, been multiplied beyond all number. Spain and Italy, which, before, were but two of her provinces, have, by degrees (which may be considered as the natural progress of things, though they may be considered as events of great moment), become three. Portugal and the West Indies are, perhaps, in this state now as they were when the first discovery was made of the gold mines of Peru and Brazil. In the greater portion of Europe, the greater part, perhaps, of the colonies, are not capable of supplying their own market, and are

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 190

, therefore, incapable either either either of exporting or importing any considerable quantity of goods from Europe; and the trade which those who reside in them carry upon with other countries, must necessarily depend altogether upon the capitals which they have in Europe. But if those European countries should ever fall into the same state of declension as that in which Great Britain is now labouring, it would be very easy for those colonies to transfer their trade to other nations. They could send out a large number, perhaps, of merchant-adventurers from all over Europe to establish themselves in their colonies, to trade to other nations, to buy the goods with which the Europeans had been so liberall as to supply them. Such adventurers would find a great deal more profit to be made, both from what they sold at the colony itself, and by the sale of those goods at some foreign market, than by carrying on the trade themselves at the expense both of their capital in Europe and of the capital of their master in Great Britanny; because, in both places they might lose both. In such circumstances, therefore, a considerable surplus, or even an exclusive monopoly, could easily result, not from the want or inability, but from the advantageous situation, of those merchants at home.

The soldiers of Great Britanny, when first landed, were not allowed to carry arms with them, but had to wear wooden swords and bows; neither did any of them receive any pay while they remained in their mother-country. Those who had been born in Europe and were not British subjects, but of other European nations (for the French, the Swede, and Danube pirates were all of them), were not, in this case either, permitted to remain at all, or to carry arms with them; because, in case they should return, they would not be allowed back into Britain; and, in case of a separation from them, they could not be brought back into Great Britain. The whole army of the mother-city was at once disbanded; and the greater portion of it dispersed about the different parts of the empire.


 CHAPTER II


OF THE EXPENSE OF MAINTAINS AND COLONIZATIONS; OR, HOW THE PRICE OF SUCH PRODUCTION, AS WELL AS THE PRICE OF MAINTAINMENT, IS SUPPOSE TO BE INCREASED, OR INCRIMINATED UPOUNDS. 


The produce of the lands and labour of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 191

all countries, therefore, is necessarily the common stock which maintains and employs all other capitals. It is the fund, or, in other words, the price which pays both wages and profit. The price of every commodity must be paid in money.

The lawgivers, therefore, who have given this commandment, seem, upon this account to have thought it necessary to lay down a rule, not so very unreasonable, that whatever part of the price or produce was not paid in money should be given in goods; that is, in consumables.

But if, in consequence of this regulation, no part of the annual produce could be destined either to maintenance, or to consumption in the home country, the annual produce would soon cease to be sufficient to maintain and employ those who were then maintained and employed. The capital, which was annually withdrawn from maintaining productive labourers, would immediately be turned into maintaining idle and unprofited ones, and a great number of idle people, instead

L.1  The quantity of silver, it has already been shown, naturally regulates itself, not only in the different countries, in which it is employed as coin, as plate or as bullion, but in the different manufactures which are carried on in each country. It regulates likewise the value of those different materials. If the quantity of silver in any country, for example, should ever be much greater than the value which the use and occasion of that quantity can give it, its value would immediately sink below that value; and if it were less, the same quantity of silver would rise above that value, till at last its value became equal to the highest that could be got for that commodity. But though the quantity of the metal should ever exceed that value, its real price never can exceed it. The quantity of the precious metals is always regulated by the value which the quantity of their use and occasion gives them; and their use and occasion never can be greater than that value. The value of the rude materials, on account of the small bulk of the metals, cannot be much increased, but in proportion as their quantity is augmented, their real value will be diminished; their price will be continually rising above their natural rate; but the real wealth of the country being always the same in proportion to the quantity of those materials which it possesses, its real value will never rise above that rate.

L.1

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 192

. In 1755, when the French and Indian wars began, the British manufactures were in such great demand in France, that a considerable number of them were imported into the kingdom. This importation increased so much, and the price paid for the manufactures so little increased so fast, that the king was soon obliged to prohibit the carrying trade between France and Great Britain. In 1766, when this prohibition was taken away by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, a very great proportion of the French manufactures, which before that time had been imported into England by British merchants and sailors, were brought back by French seamen, who carried them upon their own ships, to the number, at that moment, probably not inferior to what had originally been imported. In 1767, when the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle took place, the number of French manufactures which were imported into England amounted only to one-fifth part of what it had been in the preceding year.

L2 The balance of trade is supposed, therefore, always to turn in favour of those who trade upon the free, as well of the open, as against those upon the restricted plan, according as the freedom or restriction of trade happens, first, to give a particular direction either to the quantity or value, or both of those commodities exported or imported; secondly to give a preference to the commodities of home growth or production, or to the commodities of the colonies over those of foreign growth or production; or, last of all, either to raise or to lower, in some measure, the rate of profits in any branch of trade, according to the degree either of freedom, of restriction, or of both; or, in short, in the degree to which either the quantity or value, or both of those two different circumstances, are likely to be increased or diminished by the freedom, restriction or neither. It has already been shown that the freedom of commerce generally tends to lower the profits of stock in every branch of business; that the monopoly generally tends, in the contrary to increase them, though with somewhat a different tendency; that both the monopoly and free trade tend to render, in every particular branch of commerce, a particular branch of industry more or less dearer than it otherwise might be, according as that branch is more, or less favoured or unfavoured, either by the monopoly, by free trade, by the favourable situation either of the country in general, of its trade,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 193

or of the industry which that branch employs, or according to some other circumstance; that in this manner, the competition of all competitors, in the whole extent of their operations, necessarily raises the wages, not of the industry, as it reduces the profits, but of the particular branch which suffers most from the competition of that other; but, on the contrary lowers those wages, and reduces the profits of that particular branch.
The competition of all rivals necessarily raises the wages of labour. It reduces the profit of stock, by rendering the competition more severe, and thereby raising, in the long-run at least, the rate of interest. The competition, in short (though perhaps in the narrower sense of that word), necessarily tends to lower, and in the longer-run, indeed (although in no sense of the word), to raise the wages and profit of labour, and thereby, in every respect whatever (except perhaps in that of rent) promote that order of things which it is the purpose to promote, that the greatest possible number of labours shall have their wages and profits raised, as high as possible. The monopoly, in short, necessarily promotes that order of thing, which it itself favours, and in the long-run at least, tends, in every particular case (except perhaps that in the case of rent) to raise, in every particular case, the wages and profit of the industry to which that monopoly belongs, as much as it can.

The coin, the plate, &amp;c. which the exclusive company of merchants has, in the greater London market, for several successive centuries, imposed as an absolute prohibition upon their fellow-citizens, have all contributed in some measure towards lowering the profits of the stock which carries them on. The competition of their fellow-subjects, however, has been so very severe in the London trade, that those high wages, together, and with them the monopoly, have been, notwithstanding, for several centuries past, a source of great wealth to many of the merchants. The competition of their countrymen has been less severe. It seems not to be less present in Scotland. In the trade of our own merchants, the competition of their countrymen is said, upon several different accounts (I do not pretend to warrant either the facts upon each particular account), not only never to have raised the wages, or to have lowered the profit of labour, in any branch of trade, but to have been, on the contrary

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 194

, frequently quite the reverse of this; and, in many cases, it is to be observed, rather to have depressed them, and, consequently, to have kept up the price of the commodities, at least during a certain time, above what it would otherwise have fallen to, in the actual state of the competition.
The trade, in which, the profits and wages of labour, in proportion as they rise or fall with those of other trades, they sink more or less, may very properly be called the mercANTILE trade.

But though the profits, both ordinary and extraordinary, of stock employed as traders in the mercantile trade are everywhere very much depressed by that competition; the ordinary wages, even of labour, it must be observed, in this case, are generally higher than they are in other branches.
The same thing happens, I believe, in every branch, in which the profits of stock are higher, or wages lower, than in the trade to which they belong.
The ordinary wages, even, indeed (for I have not been able to collect precise information concerning the average wages of labour), of the common labourer are generally somewhat higher in London, where there are a greater variety of shops, and where, besides the great demand for the conveniencies, the wages of labour, in proportion as they rise above the lowest common, are higher than in other parts of the kingdom, and in some parts of Scotland, than in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh; and they sometimes are higher still in the remotest parts, as I have already mentioned, and in those parts of the Highlands which border upon Scotland, where, though there are many shops, there are scarce any people, and the most remote parts of those mountains being inhabited, it is not very easy to find any workmen who come to market from any considerable town. The high price of labour in those remote parts must necessarily raise their real value, or the money value of all the necessaries and conveniences, which, in the course of a year, are purchased by the labour of these remote places, and consequently their real wealth. The high wages, therefore (I have endeavoured to show already), of labour in London, must necessarily depress those high wages of labour, and raise their price. In those remote places, therefore, they are more likely to be bought dearer. The same thing happens in the greater part of manufactures; the workmen there, being generally more numerous and

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 195

better instructed, are able to execute a much more complicated operation, with much better profit and advantage than those of any other country, where the law favours the interest of private adventurers, over and above that of the society.

Thirdly, the quantity and variety of goods, both foreign and home, which the circulating money of a great kingdom can easily purchase, must always be much less in a commercial than it would be in an agrarian state; and, in a commercial, than it would be even in a very poor state, were the whole money, either in the shape of bills of exchange, or of bank notes, kept in reserve for immediate consumption. In such a state the capital of the country must be employed in maintaining a smaller number of people, in order that the whole money might be turned towards the purchase, both of goods and services, which are immediately produced. The quantity of goods which can easily be purchased by this small number, will always be much smaller than in an agrarian country; and the money will be employed in purchasing less of them.
The money, too, in a commercial, than it can easily become in a poor, a very rich, or a very poor state; because in a commercial, as it is more easily converted from a circulating money to a deposit money; so, too, in a poor, as it is much more difficult for the same quantity to be stored up for immediate use in the shape either of bills of exchange, or of banknotes; so in a rich, or a poor state it is more difficult for the same number to be so stored. In a rich or a poor state the whole money is employed, either, first in maintaining a smaller quantity of industry, in order that it might maintain the same quantity in time to purchase more goods; and, secondly, in purchasing the bills and notes which circulate in this manner, in the hope that those bills and those notes may become current again, in the shape of gold and silver. But the whole money in such a state, it must always be remembered (though the laws are very different), is continually turning towards the purchase of goods, which can never exceed the demand of the whole annual produce.
The circulating gold and silvern, therefore, which in such states, is annually employed in purchasing the goods which can be purchased by the annual produce, will always amount to much less, and, consequently to the smallest possible quantity. It can purchase

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 196

only the quantity of labour which it can maintain; and it can do this only in so much the less.

When the quantity of the precious metals which can ever be brought to market is very small, as at present, the value of the labour which they can purchase must be very great; and when that which they can buy, is much greater, as in times of great plenty, than it was in those times of great scarcity, as at present; it must always be more advantageous to employ that part of the capital which is over and above what can maintain the whole quantity, either in maintaining productive labour, or in maintaining idle stock, than it can be in purchasing that part of the capital with which productive work can most easily be performed.
The price, therefore, at which a given quantity either can be purchased with a given quantity of the circulating gold or silver, must be in the highest degree advantageous to the person whose business is either to purchase or to command that part either of the one or the other.
The value which it bears to the proprietor or to the sovereign, is the same thing with the quantity of labour, or the power of maintaining the greatest quantity of productive labour.

In times when gold is very dear, the quantity of labour which can be purchased with any given quantity, will be much greater than it is at present; and, on account both of this and other causes (the increasing value of gold, the diminishing demand for labour), that price will be still more advantageous to those who possess that part either of the capital which employs productive labour or of that which maintains that same labour; than it could be in times when it cost only a third part of what it does at the moment, and when it cost no more than a fourth or fifth part, or even a sixth, or a seventieth part.

The same cause which diminishes the value of silver, and thereby increases that of labour and commodities generally, increases the value both, more especially, the value which is due to silver, by rendering it of a much greater value than before, or than it would otherwise be in those different periods of society. The proportion between the value and the quantity, between the quantity of silver and what can maintain the same quantity of productive, is the proportion which regulates both their quantity and value. It is regulated in the same manner, perhaps, by every other proportional relation; but, as in this case, it is the proportion which

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 197

regulates the rent of land, so in all those others, the rent is regulated by the rent, or rather by the proportion which the tenant pays. The landlord demands the whole produce, and the whole price of it, for his own use; but, in return, expects to be allowed to dispose either of it or some part, at least, of it as the rent of a certain piece of ground, upon condition that he shall have the rest of the fruits and materials of the land, and that he shall never have it for rent again. The tenant, in return, promises him the whole, and, upon that condition, gives him the use and possession, as the price of the produce. The price, therefore, is regulated by the proportion which the tenant is willing to pay to the owner of the land.
The bank, in the price of the annuity which it advances, endeavoured to regulate this proportion in the same manner. It advanced to every different proprietor, what was supposed to be, in the ordinary market, a common annuities, of equal value, or, at most, a very near approximation to such an one; that is, a sum of money, which was to replace him in his ordinary situation in the common course of things, after he should, in the mean time (which was very seldom long), enjoy, in peace and quietness, what he might have made by the use of the annuities, or what he might have had by employing the capital employed about them. The proportion which this bank was supposed to regulate in its price, is likewise regulated in the price of every other common annuity.

In order to render the price of such an annuity equal, or very near equal, to its intrinsic value (the quantity or quantity of productive labour which, in the course of the year, it will purchase or command in money), two different things are necessary. The price must either be regulated, first in proportion to the profits of stock, in which the holder of the annuity resides, or, secondly, in proportion, or rather in the whole number of those shares, or of whatever other property the holder may have; in other words, the price of the annuities must bear some relation, not only to the profit of stock, or to the quantity of that stock which, in the course 





 The Profit of Stock in the Present State of Europe,  Political economy in the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 198

present state of the commercial world, and the present condition of Europe.

In the present state of Europe the profits, both of stock and trade, are commonly very different.

In the commercial world, stock, it is said (by Mr Dupont de Nemour), makes but a small part of what the trade itself makes of all those goods annually imported and exported; and yet the capital of all those traders is supposed to amount, at least, to more than a hundred and fifty millions sterling, which is a great deal more, it is said, than in any other part either  Of this capital, however (for it is a capital only in appearance) is commonly paid out of the profits of stock; the other half being paid into a public treasury for the purposes above mentioned.

The trade, indeed, is said to be in a bad state in many countries; in England particularly, it is generally said to be so, notwithstanding the extraordinary profits made by the traders in the London market. In order to encourage this branch, the merchants in that market have frequently granted leases to certain farmers of corn for twenty, thirty, or forty years; sometimes upon very advantageous terms; at other times, upon much more advantageous terms, but always upon such conditions as necessarily rendered those terms extremely dear. In the course, however, of those forty or fifty yeas, those landlords find themselves continually in debt, which puts them in continual fear, lest the market should be overstocked, or that they themselves shall be obliged to quit the trade. The greater part, too, of them are continually under-selling their neighbours, and continually losing their customers, and consequently the whole profit of their stock.
The market is thus kept constantly understocked by the continual exportation and importation, either of foreign corn, or, if one might use the language more familiar to the vulgar than that more refined, that sometimes of foreign wines, which cannot be sold in the home market, and of which the consumption in foreign countries can only be compensated, by the importations into our own; a compensation, which is always very difficult to be made, and, in the end, which always fails of effecting, and leaves the merchants, who cannot otherwise pay, with an immense surplus. In order to remedy this inconvenience, it is pretended that a tax, equal to a third part only of the ordinary price of foreign goods, may be levied, upon the exportation and

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 199

importation of all sorts of native goods; that the exportation of all goods of a home produce ought to be taxed more lightly than that either either of the foreign goods or the goods produced within the country. The same commodities may be exported without any duty, provided they are brought within the same market, or, what is equivalent, within the port from which they were exported. But it is otherwise with foreign goods. The exportation of them is always subjected, in the greater portion of the market of every country, either to a particular duty or to a particular prohibition.

The following are some examples of such regulations.

The Dutch, in 1672, prohibited all the ships of the king of Spain from sailing to the Mediterranean, or from coming to the ports of Genua, Lisbon and Cadiza. The Venetians prohibited the sailing, either of the king's ships from their ports, or those from other European nations.

Both the Dutch and the Venetic laws, however, are not very reasonable. It is a very easy matter to ascertain, by an inquisition of the public officers, whether any goods are foreign or home produced, according to their respective qualities. But it is not so easy to ascertain with tolerably exactitude, whether the person selling them is a native or a foreigner. A tax, indeed, upon such sales, might be levied, without exposing either buyer or seller to any suspicion; and it is not very improbable that a moderate duty might be levied, upon such purchases, in the different ports of the empire, and upon such exports from one province, as might afford the greatest revenue.

But the whole revenue arising from the duties upon foreign, and even from the taxes upon native commodities is a revenue destined for the maintenance of the public. The whole revenue arising from them is a revenue which must be employed, not for the gratification of idle curiosity, or for the gratification of vanity, but in the support of productive labour, and in promoting the general interest, both of that of the nation and of that of each particular society.

It is upon this principle only, that all taxes ought, upon the whole quantity of the taxed commodity, to bear the same proportion to that of the taxed quantity of that which is subject either to no particular duty or to none that can arise from other causes. The whole revenue arising, either from the duty upon a commodity subject to no duty, or from a particular duty, which bears

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 200

a very light proportion, may be drawn back upon every such exportation. The exportation of a particular commodity, which, though subjected to a duty, bears no such moderate proportion to its value, is, by the like reason exempted from the like drawback.


 CHAPTER IV


 Of the Expense of Customs and of the Public Works which must be supported by them.

In the progress to a better government, the revenue arising from such public works, and the expenses which they must support, are both necessarily and immediately increased by the increase in the quantity of commodities to be smuggled, the price at which those commodities are imported into any particular country, the duties to which particular sorts and classes of goods are liable, and the penalties with which the violation of those duties is charged.
The expense of customs is increased in proportion, first, to the quantity, and, secondly, to that of the articles to be imported; because the duty which must first be paid, in the first place upon the whole quantity of goods, and in the second upon the different parts and subdivided portions, must be much more expensive in a large mercantilist state than it would be in a small. In consequence of the improvement of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, the quantity of all commodities, both the home-made and the imported, must be greater in all great countries than they were in the time of their first discovery. But in order that they may be imported, the duty must generally have been paid, in some manner, before the goods can be loaded upon board a vessel; that is, the freight must be paid, either by the merchant, or by some person whom the merchant has contracted to receive it. In the progress towards improvement, therefore, the duties of customs are augmented, not only with respect, first to all goods, and afterwards, to all articles, which may afterwards come into competition, or be imported into any particular state, but, secondly, and in a still more considerable degree with respect to the articles which are first brought into the country, and with which the importation of foreign goods is first established, or which may afterwards come into competition. In order to smuggle the greater portion of foreign commodities, the goods which are first imported into any great state must frequently, it seems, be of such a nature that they cannot be landed, without incursing a considerable duty, and thereby giving the smugglers a pretext for smuggling a greater quantity afterwards

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 201

. This duty is commonly a very moderate one. In the greater part of countries, the custom-house officer, when he discovers any such goods upon his master's person, has the authority to detain them till he shall have received a warrant from the governor, that they should be delivered to the proper merchant, and that the price of them may be paid by him to the proper merchant. But if he finds the goods upon the shop-keeper, and the owner of them, the latter must be immediately seized and committed to prison, without any warrant or notice being given to the other party. In some places the custom is still more rigorous, and the owner either confined to prison, or obliged to forfeit the whole goods.

Such are generally the principles by which merchants, in general, judge of the probability of smuggling, and endeavour, as much as they can, to hinder the exportation of any part of their own produce. They have generally no particular interest in the prosperity of their country; they are interested only in the prosperity or declension, perhaps of their own particular trade; and their interest is in this, as it is everywhere, regulated by their private interest, or, what comes nearly to the same, the interest of the particular branch in whose favour they judge it most likely that they should act. They have no regard, for example, to the prosperity of the country which produces the commodity which they import; and they are generally indifferent how this prosperity is or is not brought to pass. They care little or nothing, either about the quantity exported, which is, after all, the effect, or about that imported, which, they may think at least, is the cause of that prosperity; but about that part of their own stock, or of what is over and above the consumption, which they may expect to make by the sale, either of their own goods or of the surplus parts of other goods which are annually imported into the country.

Such merchants are actuated by an 




Such merchant are actuated by  a very narrow spirit of policy, and seldom think of the general advantage, either to themselves, their country, or mankind, which their own particular trade, in any particular market or country may be supposed to contribute towards the general prosperity or declension of the society, beyond the private interest, either in supplying their own wants or those 














The mercantile system

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 202

is altogether different from that which considers every individual as an end, and the public as merely a means, from which every individual is to be excluded as little as possible.

In the mercantile system, therefore, every individual, though not absolutely prohibited from coming into any trade, which he thinks proper to enter into upon his own responsibility, is obliged to submit, at all times and under every pretext (except perhaps in the case of national emergencies, in which he is at liberty, upon extraordinary occasions, both to prohibit and to permit the carrying on of such trades), either to the absolute prohibition, or to the limitation, not only to the number of his customers, but to the trade which he can execute at any one time within the limits of his employment.

The monopoly of the home market is thus established for every particular commodity, in the same manner, whether it be called a commodity for home consumption, or one of the foreign luxuries which are exported in exchange for it, or even a commodity for foreign exaltation, as a necessary of national policy. The monopoly of that home market, too (though in this case it is of a different kind), is the sole cause of that exorbitant increase of the prices of many foreign luxuries, and the diminution of many commodities of the most essential necessity. It is in reality the monopoly of the foreign trade, for the purpose, perhaps of supplying our people's want with something more agreeable, more useful, or more ornamental than the commodities which actually come to them from the foreign countries in exchange for it. The foreign trade of luxury, therefore, is, as I shall endeavour hereafter, to be regarded as one great system of monopolies; the home trade, or the carrying trade, as another. It has been the principal cause of the great rise in price of the necessaries of life in every age and country. The monopoly of the home market, however, has been the greatest cause of the diminution in the quantity and variety of commodities of all other kinds, of which any part could be sent abroad, but for a remittance, in return for a part of the rude produce which had been consumed within our country.

It is upon this account only, I believe, that, since the establishment of this monopoly of home consumption in the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries (for the first time in the world, perhaps), that species of industry which consists chiefly, not in the cultivation

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 203

and improvement of land, but of the manufacture of the materials which are annually purchased with that annual purchase; that is to speak generally of the manufacturing industry, has, during these several centuries, enjoyed a very advantageous situation in all the commercial towns of Great Britain.

In France the exclusive privileges which have hitherto subsist among manufacturers of every kind, have, in some cases, even been accompanied with a considerable drawback of their duties to the sovereign, and a very moderate duty to other persons; sometimes, too (for it is not always the same thing to give up duties to one order of men for a consideration which is given up for another), with no drawback at all, or only very moderate duties; as, in 1755 and in 1697, for example.

The manufactures of Holland and Denmark are not, like those of England, confined to the market of the home market. They abound both in foreign and home consumption. The foreign goods of the greater part

L.1d., for a barrel of Dutch wine; 2d., for a barrel of Danish wine; 4s. for an English barrel of malt. L.1,000,000 for the stock and credit which the merchants in Amsterdam have of the bank, of which Mr Beck, their banker (and who, it must always appear to the reader, was not altogether innocent in the management of his affairs) lent them L.100,000.

L.1d., for a barrel, is equal to L3 : 6 : 10¼ of the standard of the pound weight, which at the rate of 6s., therefore (according to our present standard of money), is worth, in money of that denomination only, 1½ d. sterling. The difference is, in this case (which is not so very unlike the foregoing, and in which there is no drawback of duty to the sovereign) only L.2d.; and it amounts, therefore, only, in the whole quantity of goods annually imported from Europe, to a third of a penny, or to 3s., the quarter of our standard money, which is equivalent to L4 : 6, the eighth of our old money.

L3d. is the price which is commonly paid by the growers of the best Dutch wine for their crop. It was L3d. before 1572, when the bounty upon the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 204

exaltation was reduced to five shillINGS the hundred weight, and to two shillings upon each barrel; and before 1722, when the bounty was raised to seven shillings and eightpence, it was continued to be extended, so as, for about a third part of this period, to ten shilling the hundred pound weight, or to three shillINGS the hundred weight, the same as before the reduction. The carrying trade of the country was in this manner, during this period, encouraged by the bounty; but the import trade was subjected to a very heavy duty. In the beginning of the present century, the carrying trade of England was, at an average of thirty-two years purchase, worth only twenty pounds the hundred weight. In 1722 and 23, it cost fifty-six pounds, or eight-and-twenty per cent. of that value, the whole duty of customs. The importation, accordingly of foreign tobacco into England, during those years, amounted, according to the best accounts which have been written upon this subject, not only to more, perhaps than one hundred and forty thousand tons, but to upwards of three hundred and fifty-four hundred and seventy thousand tons; a quantity, it is said, equal to that of all those imported before the late disturbances in the Dutch trade. The whole duties imposed by act of assembly upon the importation of all goods, except salt and soap, amounted, during the same period (from 1663 to 1722), to upwards of ninety-three millions sterling, or to upwards of thirteen millions nine hundred thousand pounds sterling, exclusive of what was afterwards drawn back upon certain exigencies.

It was in consequence, therefore (according to this system) of a bounty which, from its very first establishment till it was suspended in 1698 (for want of such a bounty being again granted), was the sole instrument by means of whose favour, either the carrying trade, or the importation of foreign commodities into Great Britain, could ever, either be more or less encouraged.
The carrying and importations of foreign goods, however (by means of which, indeed, Great  The carryingand importations of foreign goods, however (By mean, indeed, I mean, of the bounties upon their exportation), were, during this period encouraged to a much greater extent than by any other expedient, though they were still far short, in both of their original proportions, of their

present height; the carrying trade being still too much under-traded, while that on the home market was much more over-traded, than at the end either of the first or of the second world wars, when it was fully equalized; but still much less so, than in the present times]




CHILD, TREATISE ON THE COMMERCE, PG 206

The carrying trade, however (by means of which, besides, Great France was enabled to sell its woollen manufacture at home for more money, than it could have made at the foreign market of Flanders, had not the bounty on its exportation increased its demand there) was, during this period encouraged to such an extent, as almost to overbalance the home trade. In 1710, the whole value of the home trade of France, it has already been observed, amounted only to one-fifth part of the whole value of its exports; and the greater part, probably the greater proportion, of the whole value of the whole exports, was derived from foreign countries. In 1712 and 1714, the whole value of its imports amounted, according 

CHILD, TOUCHES AND MARKS OF THE COMMERCE OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES, PG 208

In and of themselves, these high duties, though not altogether contrary to the principles upon which the old subsidy system was founded (for the bounty was never supposed, in its nature, either an encouragement to the exporters, nor a discourtesy to the importers, but a necessary precaution, in order that no more of the produce of our own country should be exported to foreign countries, than what could have been imported without any such encouragement), were still very much opposed by some of those very people who had before expressed their abhorrence at them.

The mercantile system of policy has, since the time of the Revolution (though, from different causes), at different periods, been supported by all the different branches, both of the ancient aristocracy, and, since 1750, by the ancient nobility and gentry of France, together with a good deal more of the modern class. The ancient gilds, though not, perhaps, the best judges of the public interest, yet being, like other great families, bound to obey, without any exception, whatever authority the king had in his hands, were necessarily disposed to support the same authority in its exercise.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 206

They had no leisure to examine the motives of government; and the interest which they were naturally led to consider as the most just and advantageous for themselves, was necessarily the one most likely, both to preserve their own existence and to secure the public peace and security. The restraints imposed upon them, therefore (by statutes, and, I believe, by the common consent both of lawgivers, and of all those affected by them), tended to restrain, as much as possible, the violence and injustice of their oppressors. The bounty, besides, though it might be a discouragement to tillage, yet it is not so much an obstacle as a stimulant to industry. By enabling a greater number of people to work at a smaller quantity of subsistence, it encourages, more or less, every species either 




 




of labour which requires a greater expense of maintenance than ordinary, and consequently enables every labourer, artificer, or manufacturer to bring a greater price to market.

The ancient policy of Europe seems not to have considered, that the encouragement given to agriculture might tend either to raise the wages of agriculture, or to diminish the profits of stock; that it could not raise them in the one way, but only in the other. It was the avowed object of that ancient wisdom, to improve and extend the dominion, both of the human species and of the gods; to render the world more extensive and extensive, both in its extent and in its enjoyments; to render it fit to support, as fully, as easily, or more easily than any other system, that order which the wisdom of mankind, it seems, has imagined to be destined for their own benefit, or, what comes very near to this, for the advantage and happiness both of man and of the gods. But when agriculture has once been rendered as profitable as the most fertile soil, the policy of Europe, it seems, has concluded, must naturally lead towards a system, which is exactly the opposite of that which the most fertile soils and the most intelligent management of agriculture necessarily establish; a system, however (for such a one is evidently impossible without a bounty), of which the effects, however, will be the same as those of a more liberal policy. It is the avowed policy, for instance, of France, to discourage manufactures by high wages and high taxes. It has hitherto been the avowed policy, likewise, both of England and Scotland, to

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 207

raise their own price in all cases below what this bounty might otherwise have imposed upon it. The real value of silver, however, which is thus raised in those colonies, is degraded in every part of Europe, in consequence of that bounty. The real value of English corn is there generally higher, and in many places considerably higher than it would be if there was no bounty, or at a lower rate than if the bounty had never been established. The bounty raises, therefore, the price in Great Britain of corn, in proportion to that in all the other British colonies; and, by sinking, in the one case, the real value of that commodity in Great Britain, in proportion as it is raised there in proportion to what it would be in a state of liberty, it sinks, too, the real value of the silver coin which is the necessary consequence of its transportation from Great Britain to all those other countries; so that in all the different parts of the British empire, the same quantity of that metal, instead either, of being equal to, or much superior, to what it was before, becomes necessarily less and more than before, in proportion as the same quantity of it is employed in the cultivation of the different British colonies. In the colonies, therefore (for I shall endeavour to explain hereafter how far the policy which has been followed with regard both to England, and to the colonies of America, has tended either to raise or to lower, in any particular respect, the real value of the precious metal), the real value of the annual consumption of the inhabitants is degraded in every part of Europe, in consequence of that bounty.

In order that the bounty might, upon equal terms, raise the real value, not only of corn in Great Britain, and of all those other British colonies in America which produce, in the ordinary way, but that of silver, in all the different countries in Europe, two very important conditions were requisite, besides all that has already been said about the bounty, about the liberty of trade, about the security of property, and about all those other things, which I have been justnow going to treat of. Those two very important circumstances were, first, That in all those different different different countries the real wealth and annual consumption of labour should be the same; or that, in the same manner as in Great Britain, there was everywhere a certain proportion, not only to the real wealth and annual consumption of the society, but likewise to the quantity of silver

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 208

which was annually exported from each country; and, secondly, That those two very different circumstances had not only been produced, in the course of a century or two, but that, notwithstanding all those different productions, they were still, upon every occasion in the highest degree depreciating, and yet still maintaining the highest degree of prosperity in all the different countries of Europe, to the greatest extent of any of those two circumstances could possibly be supposed.

In the progress, too, in which the quantity of silver gradually increased in every different country of Europe (for the value of that metal had increased in every country equally), the value of the precious metals, as it gradually increased in them, necessarily increased with it. This is the case with the greater part of metals, which are naturally of more moderate value, than even gold and silver. Gold and silver are, perhaps, of the most valuable metals in nature, but their intrinsic value does not exceed what a small quantity of the precious stones can maintain or employ, according to its natural rates, one hundred workmen; or according to the rate at which labour naturally advances in every country where those stones occur, about six months' expense. But as the increase of wealth and improvement gradually raise the rate at which labour advances in every country, the number of those workmen, and consequently their maintenance, naturally increases in proportion to their increased wealth and improvements. The quantity, therefore, of the most important metal which nature ever threw into motion, could never exceed what the increase in the quantity of that metal, in the same manner as the quantity of gold or silver, could exceed the natural rate, or what, according 





¼

¾ The value of silver, therefore (as it rose more and further above this rate, and as the quantity of the precious stones which circulated within the same countries augmented still further), became greater, and that of the precious stones less; and as those metals, like every thing else which increases its own value in proportion to its quantity (a fact, I think, universally acknowledged), necessarily sunk more and further in their value, the value, both of the whole annual produce, as it rose more in proportion to this rise in their value, and of every particular portion, of that annual production as it fell more and more below that rate), became less and less, till it came very near to the lowest degree of depreciating values that could be imagined

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 209

, either in ancient or in modern times.

This law was, no doubt, originally intended for the encouragement of the industry and commerce of Great Britain; but it seems evidently to be applicable, not only to those particular branches of it, but to every other branch of trade, of which the interest, either of the consumers or of the producers, was likely, in consequence of such improvements in machinery, either to be more, less or the same, in proportion as the trade itself was more, less or the same. The law, therefore, not being intended to hinder, but rather to promote industry in general; not to raise its profits above the level of the common profits of stock, or to lower them below that of the common wages of labour, the industry, it seems to have been intended, would be encouraged by it, as well as the profits. But if the industry of any country should, in consequence of these improvements, either rise much above, or fall much below this rate of improvement, it is evident that its capital must, sooner or later, either cease to increase, or begin to diminish; and if it should continue to increase, though its capital might continue to augment with the same rapid progress which it had made before the improvements of machinery were brought into competition with it; its productive power must gradually degrade with its revenue, till its whole produce was reduced to the lowest possible level; and as this produce would gradually diminish with the progress, till it came very near, or quite near to the bottomless pit of bankruptcy, so must its capital gradually increase, till it became equal or greater than before.

It was in this state, therefore, when, from a mistaken idea of national advantage, Great Britain, without consulting, or, perhaps, even without knowing what she was about, enacted the act which introduced this bounty; a law of which the object was not the increase, but the diminuance of her manufactures and commerce, the one, indeed, as much as the others. The effect, however (which is always the effect of such laws) has generally, perhaps, been precisely opposite to that intention; and, in consequence of the bounty, Great Britain, since 1773 (when it began to take effect, and which was probably the case before that time, and probably during some part of the present century), has not only been obliged, upon many occasions (though, perhaps, scarce ever, upon all the different acts of parliament which

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 210

have enacted the same law) to raise the price, but, in many other ways besides, to keep the value of the money much lower than before. The bounty, therefore, as it tends directly and necessarily, to reduce the real value, must, in all the different circumstances of a great empire, necessarily tend to lower the revenue and profit which it affords. The bounty has, upon many occasions, not been a hindrance, it has been an assistance to those who wanted it; and, in consequence of some particular circumstances, has sometimes raised the price of corn, and, on many other occasions, lowered it. It has been the instrument by which, for some years past, the Dutch government has been endeavoured to ruin the cultivation and industry, not only of the colonies in the East India, but of the greater part of them in the West Indies, by restraining, in every respect, their freedom of trade. The Dutch are, upon this account very much alarmed at the prospect, which they foresee with horror, of a bounty upon corn; and their avowed object, in the mean time, is, to prevent, as far as possible (and they are perfectly well aware that it is impossible), that any thing should be done which may prejudice their own interests. They do, indeed, not seem capable of imagining that the real effect of such a bounty might, in any respect, be to encourage, rather, than discourage their own agriculture, or the cultivation, improvement, and cultivation of their plantations.

In 1773, the British government granted a similar monopoly to the French government, for the same purpose as to the Dutch, by granting them the monopoly of the importation of corn. This monopoly, however, was confined, like the Dutch monopoly, within a particular port of the kingdom. It did not take place till after the first of December 1773; and it did not last beyond the first of December 1800. The bounty which was then given to the farmers, was not, like that which was granted to the merchants, a bounty upon exportation; it was a tax upon the importations, not upon their home consumption, but into a particular warehouse for exportation. In the mean time the bounty which had been given to those who imported corn, though not a bounty upon exportation, was, like that which was granted to those merchants who imported goods from foreign nations, an aid to domestic consumption. It raised, indeed (by the second of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 211

these articles), the price of herring very considerably above what it otherwise would have been in that market, and consequently somewhat above the level of the market for all sorts of butcher's meats. But the real value of the bounty, it will appear hereafter (I. c..), was not, upon this account, much below what the market price of butcher's meats is commonly supposed to be.
The second article of the treaty of commerce with Spain gave the English East India Company, at Lisbon and Cadiz (which were afterwards both taken from them by the Spanish government), the monopoly, not only to export to India, and to buy from there the produce of their colonies, but to carry to that market all the goods of all other European nations, which had hitherto been exported to it only by sea. The East India Company were, at that time (1702) the richest company in Europe. Their capital was upwards of L.100,000; and they had a revenue annually paid by their subscribers, which amounted at that time, to more than £20,00,000. The greater part of those subscriptions consisted in money, which was lent upon interest, at four per cents; that is, four-and twenty per cent., a considerable premium for a stock which could never be employed. The East India Company were the first merchants to establish themselves in the countries to which their capital carried goods. The Dutch had carried their goods from Cadiz to Calcuttack in the reign of Charles IX., but had afterwards left the country; so that, till the English East India Company arrived in the neighbourhood of those countries, no English company had ever been known there. The East Indies was at that moment one of the most extensive markets for European commodities; the most important, too, perhaps, that ever was.

By the treaty of commerce, England agreed to allow the English East India Company to purchase, with their own stock, all goods of the Portuguese East India Company for the price of two shillINGS upon every hundred pounds value. The English East India company, at that time, were the only traders in the world who could afford such cheap prices for the produce of their own plantations, and who could, therefore, sell it for such a price to all the other European nations, of whom those commodities constituted the principal part of the surplus produce of those countries. The Dutch East India company, when they had once established themselves in India by a like treaty with England

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 212

, and when they had likewise got the exclusive trade of exporting English goods from thence, began to encroach upon that of other European companies. In 1697 they demanded a subsidy for their own monopoly, of one million two hundred and seventy-one thousand pounds. The parliament, however (for it had no other means of redress but by a parliamentary inquiry), refused to grant it. In 1699, they complained of the bounty as hurtful to their trade. But though the bounty had, before this, been considered as hurtful, the parliament, in the mean time, having granted them another, increased still further that hurt. In 1700, the bounty amounted only to five hundred and seventy-two thousand three hundred and twenty pounds; a third of what it had been before, and a fourth less than the Dutch demanded; yet the parliament refused again to grant it.

The English East India company had been more moderate in the way they taxed their own servants, who, in return, were allowed a moderate profit upon the goods exported; but they demanded the same indulgence in the case of their dependents. The parliament, however, which has always had the greatest regard to the interest of the merchants of England, and who have, therefore, been most disposed to favour those companies, was very careful never to grant any exemption from the tax to any but the servants, and, consequently, to those dependent upon them; which, by rendering their commerce less extensive than before, and thereby diminishing the number of their dependents, necessarily diminished still more their revenue, which was the sole fund from which the exemption was to be drawn. In 1702, accordingly, they demanded an additional eighty-two hundred thousand pounds, to be paid in three years time; which the parliament, again, declined to give, and, in 1703, they again complained of their disadvantage, and threatened to withdraw altogether, unless the parliament granted them an immediate exemption from all duties, which, they said, they might then withdraw too, without further provocation, if it was not granted immediately. The parliament, at this time, was not unwilling that they should have this exemption, though they were unwilling that the whole company should do so. But the parliament was then, as at this moment, very much under the influence both

Of the Expense occasioned in Great Britain, by supporting that system of Commerce which the commercial System prescribes; of the Necessesary

Expense of maintaining that System, and the Necessaries of preventing that System from ever being disturbed by the Competition of any other system of Commerce, or by that Circumspection and Industry, which are necessary in all new Commodities.




 CHAP. V.Of that Expense which is Necessesary in New Commodities for supplying the Necessesary Demand.¾

The whole quantity, both imported and exported, necessary for satisfying the consumption, is, it has already been observed (chapter I.The Trade of Manufactures for their own Manufactures), in Great Britain, regulated, partly, according 


 To the demand, which is continually increasing, or, what is nearly the the same, continually decaying;   But, secondly, according to a certain rate of profit, or according to a certain proportion between the quantity imported and the quantity exported;   And thirdly, according to the proportion which those two rates ought, each in its turn, either to bear towards the consumption, the increase or the diminution of that consumption, or, what comes to the like thing in all cases, to be a source of revenue to government;   That rate, or rate which, in the progress of improvement, naturally determines this natural rate of profit, is, I shall suppose, the natural rate of interest; or the rate at which capital naturally continues to increase.

The whole quantity of the necessaries, which must be annually imported into Great Britain in order to satisfy, first, the increase of the consumption; and secondly, that of the surplus produce which is over and above the maintenance of productive labour, is in Great Britain likewise regulated according  To the demand, that is continually increasing or declining; to the demand for more commodities of home manufacture, or for the greater part of those for which the price, both in Great Britain, at present, is higher than it was before; or to such a demand as may arise from the decay or increase of the demand for foreign luxuries. But, as this whole quantity, both imported and exported (I say neither more nor less than that) is regulated according to this natural rate of profit, the whole quantity which, either in Great Britain or in any other country, must be employed to supply the consumption, is, in each country, in a manner determined, partly, according to that rate, and partly according to another.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 214

It is the surplus, or rather, the surplus of the surplus, which is destined for expelling foreign capitals from the country; that part which is employed to augment its own quantity, or, what is the same thing, which enables it either to augment its own productive powers or to maintain those of its inhabitants. It is in the nature of capital that when it has got so far as to be sufficient both to maintain the productive labour of the country, and to augment that labour's powers, that it should, after having been employed to this purpose in the most advantageous manner possible, naturally return to being the fund which, with proper care and management (and I mean not by that improper management, but with the strictest economy and parsimony), may be applied either to increase or to maintain that productive labour, and to which, in consequence of the improvement and cultivation, that labour can always, in the end, return as fully and as abundantly as before. But if, instead, therefore, of the whole annual produce of its land, or, what comes to nearly the same thing, if the annual produce were to be distributed among so great a number of people as would easily afford subsistence to one, two, three or four persons; if the surplus part only, therefore, of this whole annual produce were to go to the maintaining of productive labour; if the capital, therefore, which had thus been accumulated into this surplus, were not to be employed, as in the case before supposed, to maintain that productive labour in this way; the capital which would immediately be drawn back upon its return, and which would thereby augment, instead, of what would otherwise be the annual produce of that land, the quantity, or rather the quantity of what would replace, with proper profits, the stock which had been employed about it in the first instance, the whole annual produce of its land, would, in this case too, naturally be diminished by what would otherwise be its annual increase. The capital which, instead, in this case too, of what would naturally increase every year in the country in question, were to go to maintain productive labour in the way in which it was then being maintained in Great Britain, would, in this case, be no better rewarded, and no worse maintained, than if, in the actual state of the country, its natural increase had continued uninterrupted, and in consequence of the improvement of the productive powers of labour, it was now to be employed in the way in which

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 215

that increase had been employed in the former.

In order to render any particular employment more profitable, than another equally advantageous, there are some circumstances, of the greatest importance, which must be borne in mind, before any such employment may be allowed. The circumstances are the rate at the mint, the quantity of the metal, the quality or kind, of which it consists; the quantity of this sort of metal in any given quantity, how small so ever, how great, depends very much upon the market price, or upon how much, or how little, is given for it, in comparison with the ordinary or market price of other commodities. The quantity of this sort of metals, therefore, must be sufficient for carrying on all the necessary manufactures which are carried either upon or by water. It can seldom be more than sufficient for carrying them upon those particular sorts only.

The market price, too, of corn is regulated, partly by that of all other goods, and partly, too, according to some peculiar circumstance which must necessarily regulate, too, this particular price, though, from the nature and extent of the market, it cannot well be known in any particular instance.

First, The price of corn must be regulated in proportion, first to the value of all other goods which are annually produced in proportion to that value, or in what may be called their natural price; and, secondly, in consequence either of the scarcity or abundance, of those other goods.

When there is plenty of other goods, in proportion to the value, and when those other goods are of such a kind, that their scarcity renders it more profitable than usual to hoard up corn; when the price, instead of falling, rises a good deal above the natural price, and becomes somewhat more advantageous, not to hoard but to employ this surplus corn, as soon, or rather as soon as possible, in producing something else of more use and value.

When there are scarce any other commodities, either goods of a less value, or of such a kind as to make it more profitable to hoard up corn; when, on account of their great abundance, the market price, instead of falling, rises a good deal beyond the ordinary price, and becomes somewhat more disadvantageous not to hoarding, than not even, perhaps, to to employ this surplus grain, as soon, or as soon as possibly, in producing something else of greater or more value. The price, instead, of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 216

being paid to him, would fall upon the farmer; and he could not sell his produce so cheap to other people as before. His profits, therefore (which are, after rent, the sole source of his revenue) must rise with his rent, or they cannot afford to live. The farmer, instead of making a neat profit of the whole produce of the land, must find that part of it, over and above paying for the labour and expense of cultivation and improvement, he must pay for that portion which is over and above replacing his stock, and which he may think proper to keep as long, or as little, as suited his own interest. If this part, too, should be over-traded, and consequently sell at too high an price to other farmers, the whole of what had been over-traded would immediately fall upon them; their stocks, therefore, would be immediately bankrupted; their profits annihilated; their whole situation rendered precarious, and liable, even in times not very dissimilar from those which are now approaching; the same calamity to all their fellow-citizens who had stock of the same kind in the same manner, or of any other sort. The distress which such bankruptcies occasion in every class of our society, would be much more destructive to the public than the loss of a single shop or of one or two small branches of business. The distress and bankruptcy, however great they might sometimes appear to be, would soon restore order, and restore to all their members the full value, not of their capitals, but of the revenue which they had occasion to enjoy. The distress which such a bankruptcy might occasion, however, to the individuals concerned, was not, like the loss of a few small branches of trade, likely either to destroy altogether, nor to diminish very much, either the quantity or value, of the goods which circulated within the society; because the capital, which supported them, was not likely to be annihilated. But to destroy altogether, and consequently to diminish the whole value and quantity, of the annual produce, is necessarily to diminish the real wealth of every class, and to reduce, instead of the value, to what may be called mere subsistence the real riches, both of the inhabitants and the producers of the goods.


 PART IV

Of the Expenses of the Different Sects of Commerce in Produce, and of their respective Interest in maintaining their Merchants.

The interest of every particular order of merchants necessarily

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 217

leads them to prefer the home market, to favour, if possible, the growth and prosperity of their own country, rather than that of other nations; and it is upon this account, that the greater part of the commercial companies of Great England, for example (though not all of the same company), endeavour to promote that growth and flourishing, by encouraging, among other things, the improvement, extension, and settlement, in all the different parts of their own neighbourhood. They generally find, too (and they have generally found very well), that this extension, improvement, and settlement, is always most rapid and effectual when it takes place within their particular neighbourhood; and they are willing enough (for they have generally found it very easy) to consent that the rest of their neighbours should do the same.


 CHAPTER IV

OF THE EXPENSE OF GOODS SOLD AT MARKET-PRICES.

 The whole expense, or what is commonly called the profit, laid out upon the goods which any particular merchant sells at a certain price, must be equal, not only to the ordinary profits of stock in that particular trade; but likewise to the ordinary wages of labour in the particular employment, and to the rent of the landlord, together with the profits of the stock that employs that particular class of labourers. The profits of all the different traders and manufacturers, who are employed about the same goods at the same time, must likewise be equal, and, in general, will seldom exceed the wages of labour.

But in what proportion the profit of the whole mercantile or manufacturing stock, which is employed about a given article of goods, bears, either to the wages of labour or the rent, depends very much upon the circumstances of each individual merchant, upon his capital and credit, upon his experience in selling, and upon his industry.

In the mercantile and manufacturing trades, the ordinary rate or price at which a certain number or sort 



 4


4

of the most important goods are commonly sold, may be called the average price, or the average market price, for that commodity. The wages of the labouring poor are there supposed, in most cases (and it is not altogether so in every), not only to bear, but, upon most occasions to surpass, the market rate of wages, in order that they themselves, and all those whom they support, may have a reasonable income. The market price of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 218

corn, it must be remembered, does not always correspond with the real value of that commodity in the home market. In years of moderate plenty it may sometimes rise to the highest price which can be afforded, and, in years of severe scarcity, to the price at least which can be demanded, though it seldom happens to do either in those years, as it commonly happens in those of extraordinary plenty.

In years when there is a great scarcity, the bounty raises the price of the commodity below what it naturally would be in years of moderate abundance; and, in years of considerable plenty, the price of corn rises so as to afford the highest price which can commonly, or even in the present times can commonly be afforded. In 1722, accordingly, when there was a very great scarcity, and the bounty was at its height, the average price of wheat at the different markets of England and Wales was L.3 : 6 : 10¾d. This is equal, one-and-twenty shillings and sixpences of our present money, or four-fifteenth part of four-pence the quarter. In years when there is a great surplus, and when, for the same reason, the bounty is much less onerous than in those years of scarcity, the average money-value of that commodity sinks below what is necessary for paying, in proportion to its quantity, the full rent and profit which must necessarily be paid by every farmer who cultivates it. In 1723, accordingly, and for some time after that year (when it fell a good deal lower), the bounty did not amount even to half the old subsidy of eight shillINGS the bushel; the price at which, in 1722, it was estimated that the crop should have been valued. The bounty, therefore, during those few years, had not raised the average money-price of wheat, but, by restraining its natural price, it had sunk it so low that the landlord, instead of making a profit by its cultivation, was, for want and scarcity, actually losing a large sum.
4thly.

In the price of all sorts and species of manufactured produce, the demand for every particular quantity is in proportion to the quantity which it can afford to pay; and the market is never overstocking. The demand, therefore the demand for every particular piece of manufactured produce, is always in proportion to the real or apparent value which it bears to those who

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 219

have any discretionary power to buy it. The price, on account either of the scarcity of the home market, of the high value of some particular articles, or, what comes nearly near equivalent in all cases (for there is a great deal more variation among commodities than between the prices of those which they are all meant either to represent, like corn, or to resemble), arises altogether from this discretionary power. The high and rising prices of some sorts of rude, and even some manufactured, produce are the effects, not so much of a diminution in their real, but in the increase of their imaginary value; and the high prices, accordingly, of many sorts, particularly of coarse woollenegrasses, & Reconstruction, are in part, perhaps, owing to the increase in their real, or, as it is more properly expressed, to the augmentation in the nominal price. The rise, too (for it is a rise which is sometimes natural, and at other times artificial) in the prices, of corn, and, consequently, of butcher's meats in particular (for these, though not raised at home by human art, have been artificially brought into the home-market, and are there sold at a much higher price than before) may, perhaps in the long term, contribute somewhat to reduce the profits even, of the corn merchants, who are the immediate consumers.

The home-market, however the direct supply from the farm is interrupted or hindered, cannot long supply the consumption of the whole society; and, consequently neither can it always maintain the rate at which the whole society produces, consumes or consumes. The surplus, therefore, must be reared, manufactured, and distributed, by some other market; and this, it must always be remembered, must always be the market in the town. But the towns are not only continually augmenting, in all their different branches, their stock of all the materials of their manufactures, their mines and all their inland navigations and fisheries; but in almost every branch of foreign trade too, there are new and more numerous competitors, whose eager competition forces up the wages of labour, both upon the one side and upon all those against which it sets itself.
Access to this new and more abundant supply is the immediate object, and consequently, of all the attention, that can be given either, first, towards improving, in any particular trade; or secondly towards supplying it with a greater abundance, or with something which is likely to

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 220

be a more valuable addition to its produce.

In all the different branches either either of foreign, as well as domestic, trade, a liberal system of free ex-portation, and a more liberal system in general of free importations, would operate exactly the same, or nearly to the same extent, though in different countries. It would be the interest of all the different nations of the same kind in a particular country to open their ports as widely, as equally, and in every respect equally, to every other nation in their neighborhood.
The liberal policy of England has, upon most occasions, been able to effectuate this opening of the ports of Great Britain, and consequently of the greater part, perhaps, of all the British colonies in North America. The Dutch government, which at present confines the ships of its colony merchants to a port of Amsterdam, would be perfectly happy, upon such occasions to receive those of any other nation into the port which they pleased, and, in consequence, to be enabled, with the utmost freedom, both to send out and receive goods of every kind from all other nations, without any restriction or obstacle whatever, provided it was done always within a certain port. Such liberal treaties of commerce, it has already been observed, are not, upon most occasions (I am aware of the mistake), advantageous, to the country in whose favour they are made; but to that of which they give some advantage, and consequently some advantage in return. They give a great trade to that particular nation, which is thereby enabled both, first to send out a greater quantity, and, secondly, to receive, with less trouble, a greater variety and value of goods from all other nations; the merchants of the particular country, in consequence of this freedom of trade, being able both to buy a greater quantity of the produce of other countries, with less labour, and, consequently, to make more profit from the sale of it; a profit, which they can always draw back upon themselves with much greater ease, and which is always more than sufficient, for paying, with their ordinary profits, what they advance towards the expense, or what is necessary for supporting, the other expenses which they may have in the management of the trade.

Such liberal treaties, therefore, though not altogether so advantageous, are certainly advantageous to the particular countries which conclude them.

In a particular country, where the demand for every particular sort or species of rude produce, or for whatever else

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 221

may be wanted for the supply of that demand, happens to be greater than the quantity of it that can conveniently be brought to that country in any other, the legislature may, without violating the natural liberty of the people, impose certain duties upon the importation of this particular sort of rude produce; but no such duties are necessary upon that of almost any other. The natural liberty of the inhabitants of any country may, in all cases, be trusted; and they can, without any injustice to themselves, refuse to pay any duty which the legislature may impose for the purpose of raising their price in the home-market. If the home-price rises, they will generally find a way, by some smuggling, to get rid of their share, and will buy their goods from foreign dealers at a much better price.

It is not, perhaps (though I have never been able, by any experiment, to prove it), the system of taxation by bounties, instituted by the English parliament in 1695, that has given occasion to this extraordinary increase in the bounty upon the importation of British manufactures, but, on account of the great encouragement which that law gives both the importer and the exporter, to what may be called the bounty upon the exportation, it is the only system that has done so. The importations of the greater part, if I may say so, the ninety-nine per cent. of the rude productions of land, of corn, for example, have, during the same time that this bounty has been in force, fallen very considerably below what the demand of the home market requires. In 1722 and 23 Car. I. c. 15 (the year at which the act for increasing the bounty first took effect) it was enacted, That the bounty of L3 upon the importation of each ton of British iron, of each calendar month, should be increased from twenty-five to fifty pounds. The importations of British steel, too, were, during those two short years, raised from twenty-five to sixty pounds. But in the year 1722, the price of British steel, it appears, did not sink below that price, at the rate which had taken it up in the year before. It rose, therefore, in 1722 and 23 Car, and sunk gradually afterwards in 1724. The importation, therefore, in 1724, exceeded what could have safely been imported in that year; and the bounty, by augmenting the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 222

demand, and diminishing, as it always does the supply, must have increased somewhat the difficulty of getting it. But the bounty, it has already appeared, was a bounty upon exportation, and not a bounty upon importation. If the importation of the corn which was brought in by means of the subsidy had, during this year, increased in the same manner as in 1724 (by a very small addition to its value, and by a very small reduction in the quantity which could have been imported), there would, no suspicion of fraud or smuggling, have been sufficient to justify the continuance, for another year, even of this very considerable addition. But the whole annual importation was not increased in the one year, and it was, in the other, considerably diminished. In the end of the war it was, in reality, destroyed altogether.


Third Period: From 1740 to 1800

The third period begins with the late re-establishing, by the act of navigation, the trade which had been carried on between England and the plantations, before the late disturbances of the British government. The importation from the colonies of corn and cattle increased very considerably during this period; and this increase was probably owing partly, not only to the bounty of the 5th Geo. III., but to the extraordinary encouragement given by that statute, to those particular branches, which, before, had not enjoyed so great a preference in that favouring country as in the favourifying. The trade between the colonies and Europe, therefore (though it was not, like that with which it was connected by the original treaty of commerce, entirely free) was probably much more liberal during the third than it had been in the first two periods. The bounty, however, though it augmented greatly this second increase, did nothing towards increasing that of the former. The importations, indeed (which are here represented as the only effects of the bounty), though they increased considerably in both years (by a much greater addition to the real value of the colony corn than to that of the European corn imported, by an equally great reduction in that which was brought from Europe to America), were still much below their natural rate, when the bounty ceased, and were, in 1755, still much below that rate, when the act of navigation was revived. The importation from the West Indies continued to grow very rapidly, till the act which abolished the monopoly of tobacco was put into execution, and the colony trade opened

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 223

up to all his majesty's subjects. This act opened the market of the colonies to the goods of all nations, provided such goods were purchased with the produce of their own industry. But the greater part, it appears, had not yet become industrious, and therefore could afford to buy nothing with the produce of their own labour, except the materials and finished workmen for their own manufactures, and such as were purchased either in England or in the West Indies; which goods, however (by the 5th Geo III. chap 26, c. 10), were subject to duty.

The annual importation from the West Indies of the produce of their own labour, it must be observed, is not, I believe (though it is a very uncertain number, according as different authors have computed it), very great; but it has, in the course of several years, been very considerable. The value of the annual surplus produce of the West Indies is certainly not very great, and, from all accounts, may very properly be classed among the doubtful, and not of the very doubtful, quantities, of the annual importation.

In 1672,[69] the Dutch were still carrying on a very considerable naval expedition, against Spain, Portugal, Genoa, and Venice. In order to support them, Great Britain granted a monopoly to Holland for a limited time; that nation being at that time the greatest producer of gold and silks, and, in proportion, the most opulent and civilized country in the world; a nation which had, before, purchased with its own produce a very considerable share of that produced by the other three nations, and which was, therefore, entitled to a monopoly for the same purpose. This monopoly, too, lasted only for five-and-twenty years, and was afterwards prolonged to seven hundred and twenty. In 1697, the year at least of which history has been preserved, Holland exported to England more than L.5,500,00 sterling; a considerable sum, but a small portion of what it had annually imported during that time. The annual surplus of Holland, therefore, had probably been very considerable, and had been annually added to the annual produce of the West India trade. It seems, however (according 



¾



The yearly importation from the West Indies has, during these last eight years, increased very considerably; so that the annual produce of that trade may be considered

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 224

, not as an addition to the capital of the country which carries it to market, but, in the same manner as the annual importations of corn, as a deduction, either from its capital, or from the capital of some other person. The whole annual importations may, therefore, in the same year, be considered as a new capital, and may replace, together with the profits of its owner and employer, the capital which had been employed in raising, manufacturing and exporting that particular quantity of corn. The annual importation of gold, accordingly, has, during these eight years, been continually increasing; and the whole value, at least in money, of what had before been imported, may be considered, even at the low price of eightpence the ounce of standard gold (three shillINGS the ounce at the rate of fourteen years purchase, or at twenty shilling and fourpence sterling the quarter of the present money, equal at present to L.33 : 17 : 6), not as an additional capital, but, as the equivalent of an additional profit.

The whole annual produce of the East India trade may, too (for it is much greater at present than it was in the time of the first Dutch settlement), be considered as an annual deduction from the capital of the countries which carry that to market, in order to be replaced, together with the profits, by those of other people who bring the same commodities to that market, from all the different countries of Europe which are connected by a free and easy communication, either with the Indian trade of Bengal, with those which trade directly to India by the Cape de Verd Islands, or from the countries of the Mediterranean which lie round the Baltic and Black seas. In the course, therefore of these eight years, the whole value which was paid for those goods in the one part of the British empire, must have been deducted, not from its capital, as a new loan, which it had occasion for again in the year to come; but as the price of a new stock, of the like kind with that which had been annually withdrawn from it before. In consequence, not only of the increase in the annual consumption, but of the gradual and insensible rise, in a much greater proportion than the one would naturally be expected, both in their quantity and value, both of those goods, in a great measure, become annually dearer, not cheaper, than they were at any former period, or even in the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 225

beginning of the present century; and though the money price of all goods has risen somewhat in the course of this century, it is still nowhere so high as it would otherwise have been in the actual state of the trade. In the greater part of manufactures, indeed, the price paid by the consumer, is regulated, partly, according 





 The greater part of manufactures, indeed, are, in every country, subject to certain fixed rules and principles, by which the profits and losses of all the various branches of business must be regulated; but in no particular manufacture, are the wages and profits of labour, or of stock employed in the employment of those two different species of capital goods, necessarily regulated by such fixed rules or regulations. In every particular manufacture the wages of the labourer must generally be regulated, partly according to his strength or dexterity as an instrument maker, or as a weaver, or in some particular branch or species of clothiers, but, partly too, in proportion to his ordinary profit or gain. The profit, or the wages of the farmer's labour must likewise, in most cases, be in this manner regulated, not in proportion, but partly according to the extent, quality and goodness of the crop; and in some cases, too, it may be necessary that those profits be so, partly, and partly, and sometimes not in proportion to those two circumstances. In the price of corn, for example (the principal article in the agriculture and manufactures of the greater part of Europe), the profits of the farmer must generally be so regulated, partly, in the same proportion, but partly in an opposite manner; in an opposite manner, too; in proportion to what he derives from its improvement, in order to enable him to raise it higher, either in price, or in quality; and in proportion not to the quantity, which is always equal, or nearly equal, to what he can employ, in raising that quantity; in the way in the world of trades and manufactures, by dividing his stock between several trades, and in such an arrangement, which will naturally be adopted in all such trades, as may best suit the situation and the interest of the trader.

Though, in the greater part, therefore, both the wages of labour and that profit of stock which is derived from improvements in land and in manufactures be in some degree, and sometimes quite indifferently regulated, according as they happen either to rise in proportion to these circumstances, to fall in

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 226

consequence of them, or not to change at all, it is not because those circumstances necessarily determine the rate of wages and profit in all cases; it is rather in consequence of those circumstances that they sometimes determine it in one, sometimes in another. The variations in the profits of stock arise from many causes; but the variations in those wages, in proportion to those different circumstances which sometimes give rise to them (as in every different stage of improvement in the productive powers and the market value of the different parts of the rude produce of the land), are always altogether independent of those causes.

The wages of labour, it must always be remembered, though in a country not taxed in any respect, yet, by the natural laws of its progress towards wealth and improvement, must rise in proportion to these different circumstances, and, consequently in proportion to the increase or diminution of the tax, in proportion, I believe (though I have no reason to believe otherwise), to the real and supposed progress of the real wealth and improvement of that country, in consequence of the increasing improvement of the mines, the increasing cultivation of the land, and the advancing improvement of manufactures and commerce, in consequence, I say (I am not here going into very great detail), of all these circumstances, and in consequence both, first, of a gradual and uninterrupted improvement in those parts of the rude materials, of the instruments of husbandry, and of all other the instruments of trade; secondly of a more or less unequal division of employment; and, thirdly, of the increasing competition of foreign capitals against that of domestic capitals, and of the increasing wealth and population, of the countries with which those capitals trade, in consequence both, first, of a still further increase in the quantity of gold and silver which can be employed about the business; and, secondly, of a still further increase, in proportion to this increase, in proportion to this greater and still further extension of the world in its neighbourhood; in other words, in consequence, not only, but in consequence of the same increase, but of an increase in all the different branches of trade and manufactures with which the capital of a private individual is connected, and in all those which it trades in conjunction with other capital. The increase, indeed (for there must, in every country be some increase, and some decrease) in the quantity of gold, or in what is commonly called money, in the society, is the effect of a greater and more rapid increase,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 227

not only of industry, but also of population, and must therefore increase with that increase; but it must not increase in such an extraordinary manner as either the industry, or the number of the people, can afford to pay the wages of the labour. It is the increase of money only which can give occasion to either of these two extraordinary effects, and it can give occasion neither.
The quantity, therefore, of gold and of what is properly money in the greater part, and what may be called its price in the less, of all the different societies which have ever existed, must always, from whatever cause, be precisely the proportion between the respective quantities of those commodities, which were produced by the industry of each society, and which could be bought by that industry; that is to wit, the quantity which could purchase, or be paid for the consumption of, that particular quantity, or the value of the commodity. It has never been so, and could never be, so.

It has been the opinion of the greater part of modern economists, however, that the increase of gold and of money in any society necessarily increased, first the quantity which could be employed in purchasing the necessitous commodities of the society, and, secondly, that quantity which could purchase, and consequently the value of, the annual produce. They seem not, at least upon the principles of this system, very sensible of any such inequality, and imagine it only a transitory, occasional variation, which happens, in the progress of things, to take place in one of two ways, either, first, in the proportion of the money to the consumable goods, or, in other, in that which takes place between them; or, as it seems to be commonly understood, between the money which can be employed in purchasing necessaries, and that to be employed in luxuries. The quantity which could be employed in purchasing, they call capital. That which could be employed in buying luxuries, is called consumption.

The quantity, accordingly (for there must, however, always be a certain amount, or rather there is always an amount, of each of those commodities), which can be purchased by means of a certain capital, is always precisely equal to that capital. The capital, therefore, which is necessary to purchase that portion, or, more exactly speaking the price of that portion (of what can at best be called a manufactured commodity, such as a piece of linen or cloth), of every such

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 228

commodity, must be withdrawn from the circulation of the society, in order that it may be placed in a fixed capital in the hands either of a master manufacturers, artificers, or merchants. It will generally be withdrawn, therefore, from the employment of those whose employment it is most necessary to reserve to them; and it must generally, too, be withdrawn from those whose employment it can most easily be restored to.

The capital which, by means of a tax of this nature, was laid out upon the improvement, extension, and maintenance, of land, is in every particular country different, according as it is employed in agriculture, manufactures or foreign trade. The capital laid down in the one way, must necessarily, for the same purpose, be laid down in the other, in order that the produce may be distributed to those who have a real interest in its proper consumption, or in what is fit either for their immediate consumption, their workhouse use or their lodging.

The tax upon consumable goods, which is imposed only upon manufactures and the foreign commerce of a great empire, necessarily raises the wages of the workmen employed about them. But the capital of a master manufacturer must necessarily be withdrawn, in the first instance, from maintaining those workmen; and, secondly and more indirectly, from employing the workmen in the way in which that master chooses to do so, and in which, by his superior skill and dexterity in the mechanical employments, he is able to command an advantage in the market. The tax, accordingly, which in Great Britain is imposed only upon foreign trade, necessarily raises the profits of the merchants and master manufacturers, and sinks those wages and profits, in all the different branches of their respective trades, in the same manner, perhaps, as the rent of the landlord sinks those of the landlord's estate. It is the same thing, however, with the tax upon the produce of land, though it operates through all those different trades in quite a different way, as we shall see hereafter, when I come, in a more particular chapter, into the discussion of taxes on the produce of land. In every different branch, indeed, of the foreign commerce of Great Britain, excepting, probably, that of some foreign states, the tax upon consumables is very small; and in all the greater part of the other foreign commerce, it operates exactly as in the case of the land-tax. It does, however, operate, as I shall

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 229

endeavour, to raise the price of those commodities, by making them more dear and scarce obtainable, and thereby diminishing, in a still more important degree, their demand. The effect of all this is to raise their real value above what it would naturally be, had there been no bounty.
The bounty, therefore (and the monopoly of foreign trade), operate to lower the rate of interest, not only in the colonies, but in all other parts of the empire. The interest, therefore, in all those other places must be somewhat lower than it is at present in the colonies, in order that they might have the advantage of the bounty. The same cause operates to raise it still higher in the mother country, in consequence of what is called the exclusive commerce clause.

It has been the principal object, both in England, where the colony laws are still in force and in France, to prevent that commerce which is supposed, at least in the present state of things, to give rise to the colony trade. The colony laws have accordingly been so very severe; so that the trade of England, even among those who have the least share, is, by all the different branches, more or less restrained. But though this commerce is, perhaps, less extensive in England, than in any other European country, it must necessarily be less extensive in France; for, as England is less advanced, France can boast of having advanced much farther. France has, besides all this restraints, the most perfect freedom in commerce, which is the necessary foundation of all great commercial empires. In all countries where the law does not prohibit the exportation of corn or other goods from one part to another, there is a sort of free competition among merchants who import those same commodities into one foreign country. But where such prohibitions take place in the home market, the competition is so very unequal, as almost always to reduce the importation into the home market below the natural, or what the state can easily afford to purchase, even in the dearest, condition. This is what takes away almost entirely, both from England and France the advantage of their respective colonies. The French colonies in North America, and those which lie south of the Alps in the neighbourhood of Italy and Germany are, perhaps, in a much better condition than those which lie north and south of Cape Finisterre. The English colonies are, in general and generally speaking, a good bit worse off, than those which lie north of the equator.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 230

They have been more exposed to this destructive sun, but have not suffered so severely themselves. The French colony at St Domingo, though not so well situated, is, perhaps, as well situated for producing the precious metals as any of them.

It is in the East Indies that all the commercial capitals of Europe are chiefly directed; the countries which are most remote from Europe. There, therefore, it must be that, whatever be the natural or artificial fertility of those mines which produce gold, silver and diamonds, the returns must be most rapid and the profits highest. In China, the greater part of the commercial capital is employed upon foreign trade; in the East Indies it makes a great part of that employed in the cultivation of rice. In China and the East India islands, accordingly the annual return upon the whole value of the annual surplus of the rude materials annually consumed there, is, upon most accounts, much more rapid and the profit highest than in any other part of Europe, even upon the lowest and most vulgar account.

The returns, however (for there is no certain criterion, I believe, by means either of rent, interest or profits, by which to determine between what may be a profitable trade and one which is not so), are still faster in China than in any other part of the East Indies. China produces a much greater surplus than the whole annual consumption of the East Indian colonies; and, as the annual returns are still quicker, so, on this account, the profits must necessarily be higher in China than in any other part of Europe, even though we should credit, as we ought to do, the very extravagant account which has lately been published of the rate of interest in the Chinese currency. The annual surplus, indeed, in the different parts  of the East Indies is very nearly the same, though somewhat more irregular in some of the smaller provinces. The annual returns are likewise very quick, and the profit, therefore the whole greater.

The East-India trade of Europe is, in general, carried on with the surplus produce of its own colonies, which it exchanges with those in its neighbourhood. The returns, therefore, upon that of the trade are still faster in the former, than in the latter, and the profit higher in the latter than either in China, or in the East-India islands, though they may not appear, from the accounts which I have heretofore received of them, to bear any regular proportion to the returns

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 231

of those other two branches of the European trade.

The profits which the merchants make by the trade to America and Brazil exceed those of almost every European country in Europe, and they bear a regular proportion to those returns. In 1722, Mr Hume estimated the profits of the American trade at five hundred thousand a year; and in 1736, Doctor Burn, who was then President of the Royal Academy, gave them a number much higher; six hundred and seventy-five thousand a-year. The Dutch East India company had at that period carried trade to the West Indies to a great extent. Their capital was at L., or L.2,000,000; the whole capital of the country, including that of the colonies, to the amount of L.,600,000,000. In 1736 they had no other foreign commerce but the trade with America. Their capital, therefore, could not well exceed six hundred thousand pounds, and their annual profits must have amounted only, one might imagine, very nearly to this sum. In 1737 they began a new trade with Brazil. The returns upon their American trade were, at that time (1739), much more slow than they were during their long residence in Brazil. The Dutch East India company had been obliged to give up the whole trade to America, in consequence of a dispute with the British government, over the jurisdiction and taxation of their plantations there. In consequence, therefore, both the capital of those two companies, together, amounted to L.,800,000. The annual profits of the American trade were then L.,800,[47]000; those of that of the trade to Brazil, to about two millions a-month. In the year following, however, the profits of the American trade rose to about three hundred and fifty thousand, which was more in proportion than that of either of those two former years to what had been their returns. The profits of the East-India trade, therefore, during this interval, did no more honour to their own nation than they had ever done before.
3. Of the Trade to Africa, and to the Islands of the West Indies, and to some of the Mediterranean and East-Indian coasts, by a new Route, by the Cape of Good Hope, by the Cape de Verd Islands, and by the coast of Brazil, Portugal. The trade of the Portuguese East-India Company to Africa, and to the islands of the West Indies, and of other European nations in the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 232

same manner to those countries, have, in this case, not only given a new value to those metals, but a still greater one. The mines which were wrought in the reigns of Elizabeth, and before the late disturbances of the government, afforded a metal which was worth, at the rate of L.2 : 1 the pound of gold. But those which were wrought in the course of the four last-mentioned wars, in the course of which Great England was almost constantly engaged in a naval and foreign contest, and which, therefore (though they did not yield their price till after many recurrences), were all wrought in the course of a shorter period, afforded, upon that occasion, L3 : 2, or 4s. The silver mines which were wrought during the same period, though less abundantly, were equally valuable, and, therefore, afforded L3, or even L5 the ounce. In 1722, accordingly (the year in which the first discoveries of the American mines were made), the ounce weight of pure silver was at London market valued at L.3 : 8, and in the following years it gradually rose to L.4. The value of gold never exceeded L.1, and silver seldom did so. The discovery of the abundant mines of America, therefore, gave a new and much more extensive field for the production of those metals, than that in Europe had ever before enjoyed. The discovery of America, therefore, opened an immense market for the productions both of Europe and of America, and the competition of the former immediately set about preparing the ground, by opening, as much as possible, for the further production of those commodities. In a short time, therefore, those metals, though they had before been very dear in Europe (and, notwithstanding this increase of demand in consequence either of the discoveries of the Americans, of the French colonies in North and South America, of some other new discoveries in those parts of America, of some improvements of the mines in Peru and Chili), were all very cheap there. They were cheap enough to encourage the consumption of those other commodities; and the competition of the English manufacturers soon forced the price even down to that low mark which nature would otherwise have assigned to them. The Spanish colonies of America, on the contrary, though they had before enjoyed some share of this increase of demand in the European market, yet, in consequence of the violent and arbitrary conduct of their sovereign (and notwithstanding some improvements of their mines in the meantime

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 233

), they have never been able to enjoy it at the same rate in the Spanish market as in that which they enjoyed in the other. The price which they paid for the surplus produce of their own industry was, in the one case very high, in the second very moderate, and in the third much below what it naturally might be. In consequence of the violent oppression which their sovereigns exercised over the merchants of all Europe, the price of all goods carried to the Spanish colonies, in consequence of their being allowed to trade directly to the European markets without going through the ports of Lisbon and Cadiz, was raised very high. It is not unreasonable to imagine that the greater part, and, in fact the greater part, of the surplus productions of America, which at that period consisted chiefly, not in corn, but in indigence, might, in consequence of this high-handed and oppressive policy, have been sold there for more than double the value of their actual value; that in this state, the Spanish colonies might have become in a great measure independent, and might, in the mean time, afford an important market to the European goods which were carried to them from all the other countries of the world; and that in consequence of all these advantages, those goods might have gradually increased, both the quantity and value of the annual consumption, both of the Spanish colonies, and, consequently of that annual produce which, by increasing the competition in the European, they might have afforded to the other countries of Europe, which at that time enjoyed a share, but a very small share, indeed, in the general increase and circulation, either of gold or of silver. The excess, or rather, the deficiency, of demand, which, in consequence of this high-handed government, has ever since subsisted between the European and the Spanish colonies, has hitherto prevented them both, from becoming, like other independent nations, independent, and from affording an advantageous market for the European goods which are annually carried thither from all other countries of the world.

In the progress of improvement, it is the interest of all countries, of all civilized societies, to increase in their annual production the value of the surplus part of what their land and labour produces. But in consequence either either of this increase of demand, which is the effect of the improvement of the lands of every society; or of the increase of the expense of maintaining productive labour in every society, the surplus produce, the annual produce which remains

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 234

after replacing the stock of all the different productive labourers in the society, is necessarily increased.

This annual increase of produce can be either employed as capital or distributed among the inhabitants as wages and profit; and it is in this manner that all improvements are brought about.

When capitals have been accumulated by a particular class, it may sometimes be necessary to employ them as a revenue, and to give them up, for some part, for a share of the land rent, the produce of its land, in the same manner that it is commonly given up in the payment of taxes, and in the payment, besides of the interest and commission, both of those sums. The capital, after having been so accumulated, can, no more than any other capital, be disposed of as rent.

The capital, therefore, accumulated by the mercants of a particular country, can, in this case too, either be disposed either to capital, to wage labour or to be sold. It can either, first, be turned to the use of the society, and employed in maintaining productive labourers in its neighbourhood, or, secondly, it may, in the maintenance of unproductive labours, be turned to the sale of its own commodities; and, in either case, it can bring about some improvements in the state of that country, of the quantity and value of that annual produce which it maintains in its neighbourhood, either in productive, as in destructive occupations; or of that which is annually circulated in it, in order to be reproduced again in some new form, either in productive occupations, as manufactures, or as lands, as cattle, or as the rude produce of the earth. In the former of these cases it raises the real value of that annual produce; and, in the second, its reproduction increases that value. In raising its real value it adds to its price the value of its additional annual production.

The capital, accumulated in the mercantile state of every country, is, in all cases of great prosperity and plenty, turned to the use of the country, or to its own increase. It can either be turned to the one use; or it may, in the maintenance either of unproductive labourers, of artificers, manufacturers, or farmers; or of menial servants and out-servitives; and in the one way it adds, not only the value, but the power, to that of that produce.

In the other

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 235

colonies, however, it has generally, perhaps, proved more troublesome to establish a civil government, than a foreign trade of consumption. In the British American colonies alone, it has frequently required two different governments, each under a distinct executive, and under separate legislative authority, in order to restrain the insolent excesses of the other, which have sometimes overturned the government itself. The Dutch, in their dealings with the colonists in North America, seem not to have made so many blunders. In the greater part of them, the English, Dutch, and Danish companies, seem to be the only companies that ever have made any.

It was the policy of the English parliament, therefore, in order to prevent their own colonies being swallowed up in the general confederacies of Europe, never to enter into any treaties of commerce or alliance with the natives, but to prohibit all ships of England from sailing to any of them; and this policy, so far as concerns England itself, seems not to have been inconsistent with that great political principle which is at bottom both the most just, and the most generous, of all the political maxims of the world: the policy of extending as much the market as can be extended for the produce, and consequently for the revenue and protection of all those who produce that produce, without encroaching upon any particular private interest of the people who live under the government which enacts that regulation; or, what comes very near the truth, upon no particular private interest of the inhabitants, but always upon the public interest, and always upon that which best promotes that public good.


 CHAP II.

OF DIFFRACTION, AND OF THE DRAWBACK OF TABS.


 It is the interest of all those who draw back, or who take away any part of the duties of customs, that those duties, so far as they relate either to goods imported, or to goods exported, should be precisely upon a level with the ordinary profits of trade; that is, should be neither too high nor too low; but should, upon the whole be as little drawn back, or taken away as possible, than what is necessary for defrays the necessary expense of collecting and executing those particular duties. If those duties are drawn back very little, either by exempting certain goods imported from one country, or by allowing certain exports of some particular kind, to be subject, under certain conditions, to a duty higher than what would have been paid if the goods

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 236

had been imported from a different country, this advantage of the home trade, though real, will not be so great as it would have been, even upon such liberal allowances, if those allowances had never taken place. The home trade, however, is in this case, perhaps, as it has been everywhere in the world, a more advantageous branch than either of the foreign, or of the naval trades, or even than the inland trades of agriculture, manufactures, and retail. The inland trade of agriculture is certainly more advantageous than that of either the foreign or naval branches of the inland trade of manufactures. The capital employed, and, what comes to the same, the revenue annually raised, in agriculture is, in proportion to that employed in the greater part, a much greater stock; and the annual produce of its industry is, therefore a much greater sum. In proportion, too, as this annual revenue is less than in the other three, it must necessarily be afforded to a much smaller quantity of stock. The capital, too, which is employed, in both the inland and foreign trade of manufactures, can be much smaller. In the one case, it is confined within narrower bounds than in the others; it is confined within a narrower compass. The annual produce, however great, is less liable to interruption, and consequently to being thrown out of fashion, and consequently to be replaced with less loss, by any sudden or unforeseen rise of prices in the home market. In the one case, too, it is, in general, more profitable to the undertaker; because, though his competitors may all have a share of what he produces; he has himself the whole. In the other two cases, the profits are generally less, though they are not altogether absent; in agriculture, perhaps, more than in manufactures; because the returns of the latter, in the same manner as those of the former, are generally more distant. The profits of foreign trade may, no doubt, sometimes exceed those of home trade. But, in general, the returns of both are more distant than those of either foreign trade.
3. Conclusion.

It is not by augmentations of the national capital only that the mercantile system proposes to enrich the society. It is, on the other hand (for it is a system which, in many respects, is essentially national), by augmentations in the national wealth, it intends to enrich itself, by raising its real revenue above the level which, according to

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 237

this system, it ought naturally to maintain its capital at; and, in this, it resembles, in some respects, the mercantilist policy of England.
The mercantile system of taxation, therefore, as I shall endeavour, in the four ensuing chapters to show, has, in France and Holland, not only given occasion to some very important alterations in our own tax system, but, on the contrary, seems to have contributed, in a great degree, to support the independency of those countries.

 PART II.

Of the Expense of Defence, and the Necessity and Propriety of a National Militia


The expense of defence, and of maintaining a national militia, are two distinct expenses; the one necessary, the others altogether improper, according to the system which I am endeavouring to explain. The defence, or the maintaining, not only of the society which exercises the militia, or of that particular country, but, more especially, of all other independent states within it, is evidently an object of the greatest importance. The expense of maintaining that of the society which does not exercise the militia, can never, in any country be attended to at the expense of any other independent state, without indirectly supporting the oppression either, either, of that society, or, perhaps, of that state.

In order that a nation may be at all time capable, both, of resisting, and of maintaining at home, that of the society to which it belongs may require, besides, the continual, and, in the greater part of cases the very expensive, attention and protection of that state; and this, it seems to me, is the very essence, or, rather, the sole essence, which makes the national military establishment, or, more properly speaking the whole force of that military institution which is destined to defend, protect and defend the society to whose defence, protection and defense, that institution belongs, different in different countries, and of which, in the same way as the military institutions of private persons, every man is obliged to contribute, not so very much in proportion as his share, but according to a certain proportion to which he is necessarily called upon to contribute, in the same manner as he would contribute, in proportion to his share in the general contribution of the whole body politic of the society, towards supporting, supporting, and defending the whole body politic against the invasion and oppression of other societies, of which he may be one

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 238

.
The military establishments of some countries have, perhaps, contributed, in a great measure at first, both the support and the defence, both of the society to whose defence, protection, and defense, they were originally assigned, and, in the course of time, of many different societies. But as soon as those different establishments became so complex, that the defence, both of the society to which they belonged, and of all the societies to whose support and defence, they were afterwards added, became altogether impossible; the state of those particular countries necessarily became so. The military establishments of some countries, therefore, having become entirely useless and superfluOUS; those of most others having been rendered altogether inadequate and insufficient; those, I say sufficiently of all those of France. In 1755 and 1757, the king's orders directed that the military force which had been raised by the late wars should, in all cases, and under all the circumstances which could have affected its use and service, be withdrawn. It was accordingly withdrawn, with the loss both of the credit of the army and navy of the kingdom, and of that of almost all the other public services which had hitherto been performed by it, except the discharge of prisoners of war.

But the national military force which was thus entirely and totally destroyed and withdrawn from performing any part, however trifling, either of its original or of subsequent service, was not altogether annihilating and annihilated; it still continues to be a very formidable and formidable military power; it still continues, in the course even of peace, to exercise, with great dexterity and dexterity, that military force, which, under different circumstances, it might otherwise be capable of exercising, or of performing; and it is only because the society has been at all time capable both of defending, and of maintaining at home, that the military establishment, which was destined for the support and the protection of this force of defence, has, in all cases and under every possible circumstances been subjected to such extraordinary and oppressive attention. The military force which the French monarchy, in its turn, in 1755, withdrew from defending the country to which it was attached, was, like that of Great England, a very formidable and formidable military force. But it is not the less capable of defending and of maintaining, at home, the society which was at all times attached, or, what comes nearly to the same thing, the society of the same name, to which it was afterwards detached. The

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 239

greater part of the manufactures of North American, indeed (for we are not speaking now, concerning the manufactures of Europe), were carried to England by the original colonists; but many of them, when brought into competition there with those of England, and when found inferior, were prohibited, and even prohibited altogether, on pain only of forfeiting their whole profits. This restraint, however (which, in the end, proved so effectual a restraint), had no such effect upon those manufactures which had been originally brought into competition with the produce of British industry. Those manufactures continued, notwithstanding this prohibition, and have, in fact (and not merely in name), flourished to the very utmost of their ability.


Third Sort.Of that sort in which, though the industry was originally introduced into the mother country, yet, after some years residence in it (for some of the colonies are said never to have had any), some foreign industry has introduced a better; such as the manufacture of gun-metal. The industry of the colonies is generally confined to the home market, and the greater part of the surplus produce exported. But the greater the number of foreign manufactures established in the colonies, the greater must necessarily be the surplus of the home manufactures which they consume, and thereby indirectly support; and the more likely must the home manufactures be to improve. The industry of the mother country is, in this case too, confined almost entirely within the confines of the home market; but some foreign manufactures are established within those confines; such as the manufactures of gun-metal; and those manufactures, though they have been introduced in a foreign market, yet, in order that their consumption may be extended as far as possible, must necessarily extend their business to the home markets. Though the colonies produce nothing for themselves, yet, by means of such foreign industry, some surplus may be drawn from them, which is employed, in the first place, in maintaining the industry  Of that sort which proceeds always or chiefly from the revenue, but which, by the operation either of a bounty or of some exclusive privilege, is confined sometimes in a particular market to a particular manufacture only, and, at other times to some particular employment, of which there are no rivals, or rivals of like nature. Such are, in general, those branches of trade which concern foreign nations, and of the foreign trade of consumption. Such, too, are the branches of trade, in the same manner, of which a great part of the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 240

stock of a great country is annually employed; such, for example, are the foreign and inland manufactures, of which a great part of that stock is annually employed, and of the like nature with them, though carried to some other country for further consumption. Such, for example, as the foreign and inland wines of France and Spain; such, likewise, are those manufactures which, by the employment of great capitals, can be carried from one country to another much cheaper, and with less freight and insurance than if they were all carried directly from the place where they are produced.

It may sometimes be difficult to form an accurate judgment concerning the real wealth and prosperity of any country from the accounts of its annual exports and importation. The returns from the annual balances of trade, therefore, which are made to the public, must always be somewhat imperfect, even though the returns are not very long. The annual accounts of the exportation and imports of the British empire are, accordingly (except for Ireland), very long, but the returns from them are very short.
The accounts of Ireland are, in every particular year, very long; the returns, however they may have been made from them, are very short. In the year 1721, for example, the annual accounts, published by Mr. Calcraft, contain the following information concerning Ireland:—First Sort. Outwards Trade. Gold and Silver. Imports. Outward. Gold, silver and goods. Outwards. Gold and silver and goods. Imports. Total, £3,959,943.33 : 9s. 8d. Silver, gold and goods. Total, £1,-2,943.33 : 1s.; and in the returns of this year only £3,853,944.33 was received from Ireland. The whole value, both of the goods exported and of those imported, is not more than L.1,000 sterling, which is equal to L.4 the standard measure of our silver money at the rate of sixpence a-pound, exclusive of its sinking fund. But in 1722 and 23, the Irish accounts contain no returns from either of these years.
The returns from the annual balance of trade in the British and American colonies, on the other hand, have frequently been much longer than they were in Ireland; in particular in that in the year 1700. In that year the annual returns of all three branches of the British trade

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 241

were, in all cases, over and above what could be drawn from the capital of Great Britain; and though, in those times, the profits and interest of stock were not so much defraying the expense of government as they are at present, the whole annual amount of those profits must, upon ordinary business, have been defraying it. The whole quantity of the necessary provisions of the people, which, in those days was brought into the British market by means of the British ships and coasting vessels of Great England, must likewise have been much greater. The whole quantity, too, of what is annually exported from the colonies to the other colonies, must, upon ordinary business, likewise have been greater; for Great England exports to all her colonies more corn than they export to her; and the greater the quantity of the one, the less must be of the latter, the less being brought thither but in exchange for the greater. In these circumstances, it is not very probable that, without some considerable rise in the price of those two sorts of provisions, either of British or of foreign produce, the colonies would not have suffered some diminution of their revenue, both from their annual importation and ex-portation. The colonies would probably have continued, in spite, of the law which put an end, by a relaxation of restraints, almost entirely to the importations of corn, and almost entirely, besides, the exports to the colonies, which are at present, and which were almost entirely, confined to Great England. The colonies, however, might have been relieved somewhat by a more extensive freedom of trade, and might not, perhaps, have been entirely deprived of their principal market; the home market, though, in consequence, perhaps, of some diminu-tion of their own manufactures, might, at least for some time be much more fully furnished with British manufactures than at present, when almost all the manufactures of Great England, even those of Birmingham, come into competition against the manufactures of Birmingham, which have lately been set on foot in Virginia and North Carolina.


 PART II.


 Conclusion.


  In the foregoing part of this chapter, I endeavoured to show how far, by means of a free trade, Great Britain has contributed towards the general wealth, industry and population, both of Europe and America.  But the contribution, which, in the course of a long peace, Great Britain has actually made to those different ends, has, perhaps

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 242

(though it is not, perhaps impossible), been much less considerable than the vanity and ambition of some individuals have represented to us.

Spain has not, perhaps, contributed so much to our general defence. Spain, like all other nations of European extraction, has no standing army, nor any regular militia. It has no regular standing army or regular militias. The people who compose that nation have no private interests, independent of the public interest, in the support of the civil government of their own state; nor are those interests likely to influence them in favour of our cause. They are not likely, indeed, to do so very often, because, in a free country, their natural aristocracy renders them incapable of such devotion; and their great numbers, dispersed through so vast a country, render them incapable of resisting, for any considerable time, the united efforts, of any one of their number, either in war or in defence. But, as they had never before been conquered by any great European nation, and had not, in the present times (when their situation has become much better), occasioned any considerable alteration in the government of the mother-country, the Spanish people were never likely to be more disposed than the other inhabitants of North and South American colonies to support, in time of peace, any foreign government which should attempt to oppress them.

Our American and West Indian colonies have been conquered by a foreign power. They were, before this, independent states; and, like all independent states in the world, had never occasion for any standing army. The Spanish government was, before this, under no necessity of supporting the government of the mother-country; and, like all other monarchies, was at all times secure in the enjoyment, not of a single privilege, or even any exclusive privilege; the right of presenting to the king of Spain the annual requisition for a hundred ships, which, at that time, consisted, in part at least, in the gold and silver of the country, of the produce of its lands and labour, which the Spanish monarchy had always, before the invasion, enjoyed in great measure, for its own benefit, and which the Spanish government was now endeavouring to deprive of all foreign commerce, by subjecting it to all taxes and prohibitions, in the same way that Great England subjects her colonies.

Our American colonies, besides, were not originally colonies at all; but were, like the greater part of other countries in America and the West

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 243

Indies, purchased by the mother-country for a sum, sometimes very large, sometimes not so large (for the whole trade of the mother-country was not, perhaps, much larger in the present times than it was at that time), which was, and still is very much greater, in all those different cases, than what would naturally have been drawn from such purchases, by the natural rate of the profits of trade. In all such purchases, too, it is only by the natural increase of the capital employed in them, that any considerable augmentation of the quantity of gold or silver can be expected; because, though, when such acquisitions are made, the quantity which can be brought from the mines is very small, it is always very much increased when it is brought to a much larger quantity. But in our American acquisitions there was never any augmentation of this sort, except by the accidental accumulation, in the pockets of certain adventurers, either of the greater part of their original capital, or of something else equal to that greater part.

In consequence of such acquisitions, the value of silver, in all our different colonies at least, was always greater, and, consequently, more than the natural rate of the profit of trade would have afforded to its owners. It might even have afforded a good deal more, had it been possible, to all those owners. The quantity of productive land in North America and the West India islands, therefore, was never greater, nor the annual produce of its land and labor greater, than it would have naturally arisen, if there had been a free commerce between Europe and Asia; or if, instead either of the English company or of some other adventurers, the whole trade and colony commerce had been vested in a joint stock company, with all its rights, privileges, and immunities; that company having both the power, the occasion and the motive to employ their capitals, as they thought proper, upon all suitable projects. The whole extent of the North American territory at that time, and the whole annual produce of the land and labor, would probably, in the present times, amount to something less than two hundred thousand square miles; that is, to about twenty times the whole territory which, at that time (the middle of the last century, perhaps, though I am not very exact), was occupied by the European colonies of North America; and the annual produce of that occupied territory might easily amount to several millions, or to several hundred millions of dollars.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 244

The tobacco of Maryland, for instance, which, at the rate at least, was worth more in tobacco than the whole annual produce, could annually purchase no greater quantities of European goods than what were consumed in Great Britain, or even in France, the principal markets for that commodity. It could, therefore, purchase but a small part, and consequently no more than a small quantity of the goods of the other great colonies of America, to whom the greater part of those consumed tobacco, either in the same manner, or in a still better manner. But the annual produce of Maryland is, at an average, said to amount to about six hundred thousand hogshead of Virginia tobacco. If the whole annual produce, therefore (according as I am informed by Dr Davenant, who is the authority for all such computations), could be sold at a premium price in England, and if, at that rate, a single shill of that price would purchase but about six hundred thousandths part of the whole annual produce; the English market for tobacco might annually afford but about one half of that price. But the tobacco which is consumed in France is consumed in much larger quantities than that of England; and if, according to the computations, the whole annual produce of Maryland, instead

 THE WEALTH of NATIONS, PG 246

The tobacco which is consumed in France is consumed in much greater quantities; and if according to the computings (I have no exact data upon this head, except what I received from Dr. Daverot) that which is annually exported by England, could purchase but about six hundred thousandths parts of that which was consumed in the year 1764, the French and English market would, one year with another, purchase but about one third part of the quantity purchased in the year 1764, or about one-third the price.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 245

But the French and British market are supposed to be nearly equal, so that the whole value annually paid for that part of the tobacco consumed by France would be equal, one with other years, to what was annually paid for the whole quantity consumed in those years. If the English market could buy only about three-fourths, therefore, of what was annually consumed in the French market, the whole value annually given for that portion would be equal to three-fourth part only, or to L.5,333 : 1 : 9¾. The whole annual value of the French tobacco, therefore, could purchase but L3,334, or to the value, perhaps, of a million sterling; and the whole value of English tobacco, L3333. The whole annual consumption of the French tobacco, therefore, could be sold to the public for only one third part, or about one-third of the whole price paid by the English market for that part of the French produce. The same thing may be said, I imagine, of all other sorts of French produce.
The tobacco annually imported into England is, in this manner, supposed to be worth more than five millions of livres, or about twenty years purchasing powers. But the whole annual importation could be sold to the private persons of Great Britain at one half the whole price, or about L.5333 : 1, or at the rate, one-third part only. The annual importation, however, of tobacco, it has been pretended by many people in England, is very much undervalued, as it is supposed to purchase but a small quantity of tobacco. This, no doubt true, may be partly accounted for, not altogether by the low price at which it is commonly imported into Great England; and partly, too, perhaps by other circumstances; for though the whole value of tobacco is supposed to consist in the value of the consumable goods, the value, it has been said by some, in the greater part of that value consists in a great deal of other goods besides, and of those, in particular, the tobacco itself, is a much smaller part of the consumable stock than either the tea, or the rum, for example. But the whole annual importation, in order that the whole value of the consumable goods, which consist, one with other, in that of tobacco, should not be overvalued by the small quantity at home consumed, ought certainly to be more than double, or

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 246

, at least, ought not to be less than three times the quantity at home consumed. If it were more than three times, it would be necessary to raise the duties of customs; and if less than two-and-forty, it would still be necessary to lower them.

In order, therefore, either to raise the duties of customs, or to lower those of customs below what is just and equal between any two countries, it is not necessary that the surplus of any of them, after defraying, as nearly as possible, the whole expense of collection, should always exceed in this manner the whole value which that part of the surplus contributes to maintain, either directly, or indirectly, all the different classes and orders which compose that whole value; because the whole expense of collection may frequently be fully paid from the whole surplus, and may even sometimes fall short altogether of it. The surplus which any one country can annually afford to pay into the public revenue, without incursting any other expense besides what is necessary to maintain, either the police, the army, the navy, or the public works, which are requisite for the defence, support, and support, too, of its own government; that surplus is necessarily equal to what is sufficient to pay the interest of the capital which maintains, either directly, or through the intermediary, those different classes and orders. The surplus, therefore (though not necessarily equal in the smallest degree), is always greater than the sum necessary for paying that interest, though less, perhaps, in the largest. The whole annual importation of the commodities which compose the revenue, of Great-Britain and its dependencies, is, in this manner, continually increasing, and yet, notwithstanding this continual increase of the surplus, is, at no time, supposed, to exceed the whole value which it adds, either directly, or indirectly, to the national capital, or, what is the same thing, the sum which is necessary for maintaining all those different classes and ranks of people who compose that whole value.

In consequence, too, both of the high profits upon British goods imported, and of the high duties which it is said have sometimes been imposed upon those exported; of the continual importation and ex-portation, of which Great Britain is at present both the emporium and the warehouse; and of the continual accumulation of treasure by means both both, of which the administration is at present so very negligent; a great part, I believe (

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 247

though I do not venture to say how great), of the capital which is employed in this branch of foreign commerce of Great Britain is likely, in the course of a century, not to be able to find a market in which to return. The whole produce of this branch, therefore, must either go to decay in consequence of that continual accumulation of treasure, which is likely, too, in the same period, to reduce very much the annual produce of British industry and commerce; or it will be drawn into some new employment which can afford it some chance of being employed again in this manner.


 ART. III.


The monopoly which the British government has enjoyed for more than a hundred and fifty-four years against its own colonies, has rendered the colony commerce of England as free, and, consequently, more advantageous than the commerce which takes place among the greater part of other nations. The monopoly has, in reality, been a sort of exclusive privilege, granted to Great Britain for the benefit of her own colony trade. The monopoly is, in effect, a sort of bounty upon the exorbitant profits of this particular branch, of which Great Britain is the only possibilty. The bounty, in effect is a subsidy, which, in proportion to the profits of this particular trade of which she is the possibilty, is paid by the whole country, in order, it is supposed, that the rest of the colony trade should, in proportion to those profits, be taxed as high as the British taxes. The monopoly, therefore, as a sort of mutual subsidy or encouragement to the colony trade, is a very important branch of the mercANTILE SYSTEM, which, in all its different parts, has been, perhaps, more beneficial to Great Britain than all the rest. The monopoly has, however, been a great disadvantage, in every particular colony, and has, therefore, contributed, perhaps, more to render the colony trade of Great Britain so advantageous to other nations. It seems not impossible, too, that it might contribute more to the making of this advantage still, if it was allowed to continue longer than a century. The monopoly has given Great Britain the exclusive privilege, not only to sell, at all times, to her own subjects the greater part of the surplus produce of her colonies, at a price which, though higher than the average price, is, upon most occasions, still below what is necessary for compensating, in the home markets, the high wages and

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 249

low profits which that surplus produce necessarily incurs there; but likewise to sell, at all other times (except in the case of a war, when the monopoly is suspended for a limited period), at a price which, though higher than the ordinary, or the average of what can be had in any open and free trade of commodities, is, upon most ordinary occasions, still below the lowest which the surplus produce, or, in other words, the real value, which it affords, is capable of being brought down from its natural, or the market price of that produce. It has thus given a monopoly of the home market to some of the most valuable productions of America, and has kept up the real price of the surplus produce, in that market, much above what the actual value of that produce, as it would naturally have risen in the competition with other commodities of equal or nearly equal value, would naturally have risen in the same competition. The home consumers were thereby enabled to purchase cheaper, both those goods of America, which were made for foreign consumption, as well as some goods from other parts of the world, which were made either expressly for their consumption, or for the use and consumption, not of their own country, but for the consumption of other nations.


Secondly, By restraining, in some respects, the importation from one market to another, of the goods produced at a great number, of the greater parts, not of one, but of many particular sorts of rude, vegetable, and manufactureable commodities, this monopoly necessarily tends, in every respect, to lower, more or less, the real price, the real quantity, of those goods in the particular markets into whose doors they are brought; and, consequently, more or less, to diminish the real wealth and prosperity of those markets. It raises, it is true, somewhat the general rate of profit, but lowers that of every particular sort of profit. It hinders the employment of a greater quantity of industry in those particular markets, than would otherwise go to them, or, what is the same thing, than would otherwise have been employed in them, in proportion to their natural growth or abundance, or, in short, to what their natural fertility might have afforded to the employment. The monopoly raises somewhat the general rate, it must be observed, both in the quantity of industry carried on at home in consequence of the prohibition of exporting to certain foreign countries; and in the number and variety of the goods annually

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 250

imported from those different countries. The greater the number of those goods which are annually imported, the more expensive must always be, the competition between those goods; the cheaper must always, perhaps, always, be that between the goods of the same or different nations, and between all the different sorts of rude produce which are brought either into competition with one another, or from one another. The monopoly raises, therefore, the price of all the goods annually imported from those particular countries. It does not raise, therefore, that of the goods which are annually exported. It raises that of some of the goods of all nations, but it does so much more sparingly than the monopoly raises that of some of those of some particular nations.

In Great England the colony trade, it has been pretended, is altogether monopolized; the merchants and manufacturers being allowed to export no goods to foreign nations, except such as were either purchased with British stock, imported into Great Britain, and afterwards sold there, at a profit; or such as had first come from a foreign nation, and afterwards imported back again into Great England. The goods exported by means of the colonies, however (for I do not pretend that they are altogether so), are not all, perhaps not even a third part of the whole annual produce of Great Britain, but, on the whole, not less than two-thirds of that which comes to us from foreign nations. If, in this case, the whole colony trade were monopolized, as I believe, it would still be impossible to carry on the whole, or to supply, with the ordinary quantity, both the consumption and employment of the country, with any considerable degree of profit. The whole quantity imported, would be so much greater, the whole consumption would so much more be out of joint than if the whole trade was left open, and the competition between different parts of the country so great and so violent as at present; that the profits of the dealers in the greater part of parts of the produce of the country would necessarily be so much less than at present. But if, by means of the colony trades, a greater proportion than before was being supplied with the usual proportion, and if, by the carrying trade alone (a trade, which, by the same reasoning, would, by far, afford more employment than any part of what the colonists trade has ever yet afforded), a still a greater proportion of that produce was being exported to other European nations than before, it is probable

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 251

that, in consequence of this new employment, some part, perhaps, of that old surplus, would be sent abroad again, and, in a much longer period than it otherwise might be in, be exchanged for a still greater quantity.
The monopoly of the colony trade, it must always be remembered, gives great protection both against the importation and exportation of foreign goods, of which there is a demand in Great-Britain, but against those of the same or very much inferior quality from all other European nations; and this superiority in the importation of goods of inferior qualities may frequently enable Great-Britain either to sell cheaper, or to purchase dearer, than she otherwise would be able to buy, and to sell dearest of any of those nations. It is in this respect, I believe, very much in proportion to what it may cost the colony, either to buy the monopoly, or even, what would give less advantage, to get it at so low a price. But the monopoly is a real, though it may appear in many respects a very trifling advantage, to Great- Britain; and, as it tends to keep up a certain proportion, so it may tend likewise to maintain a certain proportion, though perhaps not quite so high, in all foreign commerce. The exclusive trade, on contrary, is not only an absolute monopoly, but, as it is carried on by a different company than any of the colony trade, so the superiority in the quality and quantity, which it naturally gives, may be much greater than it otherwise would be in the whole of it, and, therefore, to all the other European nations of the world, a real, though not quite as trifling advantage.


 CHAPTER III.

OF THE IMPEDIMENTS ON THE CONSUMER RISE TO AMSCULATORY CONSIDERATION IN MARKETS.

 The rise of price, in consequence either of an improvement in quality, or of a lowering in the money price of commodities in consequence of an equal or superior rise in the real value, of land or labour; is the effect, it has already appeared, not only of a real, but of a very great relative diminution of value, or in other words of a rise in the value, both of what the commodities are supposed to contain and what their money price naturally would bear in proportion to other commodities, of the countries where those commodities are consumed; in consequence of the absolute, or rather

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 253

of the universal, superiority of wealth, of that order, of those who have it; in other words, it occasions a relative increase, and not a relative decrease, of their real price. The real, and, consequently, of all other commodities, must necessarily rise with this relative increase, and must, therefore, be higher in quantity than before, though they may not always bear a still greater price in money. The rise in price, however, of all other commodities is the effect of their real diminution in their value.
The real value, therefore, both in its absolute and relative, is diminished by the monopoly of the home market.
The rise in the real value, therefore, of all other goods, which, by the monopoly of one or other, are brought to be exchanged, not for the produce of domestic industry, but for that of the foreign, is the effect, it seems, of their absolute and relative impoverishment. It occasions, besides this, an absolute diminuation, not only of the quantity, or even of the price which they can be sold in the foreign markets of the mother-country; it occasioned a real, not only of their value in those markets; it occasionED an absolute and relative, not only of their price in those foreign, as well as their quantity, in those home markets.
The monopoly of one or more of the home markets necessarily occasions two other events; first of the absolute impoverishing of the people of that particular country; and secondly of the relative affording of employment, either to the people of that particular place, or, what is the very same thing, to the people who reside in it; the former of which is altogether accidental and transitional, the latter of which arises, as I shall endeavour to shew hereafter, from the nature and causes of the system itself, of the monopoly of one or other particular market in the home market of any country.

The absolute poverty of the country, by restraining the industry of its inhabitants, necessarily reduces them both to a narrower circle and less extensive circle of employment than what would otherwise be open, to every part of the globe. The relative affording of employment, on the contrary (which arises altogether from circumstances, of which we shall hereafter take notice) necessarily opens to them every possible employment, in all parts of the globe, and, in particular in the countries, which are most favoured by the system of private property. It opens, besides

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 254

, an extensive market to all their productions. The greater the extent of their territory, the less they must necessarily have to purchase from other nations; and as they have the surplus, so they can afford to sell it at a much better price than they otherwise might do, or than it would have done, had they not had this monopoly. The colony trade, therefore (though not altogether a gainer), yet a very great one to Great-Britain, and, I believe, to the other colonies of America. The trade, however, was, by all accounts, understocked in the late war; but the colony trade of Great Britain, which, in the actual state in which things stood, was probably much less understocked, and might have afforded a very considerable profit to government, has, since that time, been much more fully supplied. The colonies of the Spanish West Indies, which were under the dominion of Portugal before the commencement of the present disturbances in Europe, are, perhaps, the richest and most thriving colonies in Christendsland; the only colonies which have ever yet enjoyed this sort of extensive market. The Dutch settlements in Indochina, and those of Hamburgh in Germany and the Netherlands respectively, are, perhaps, the two most populous and best cultivated colonies in Christendom; and these too, have, in both, been long enjoying this market, though less so, perhaps, than that of the British settlements in North America.

It has, indeed, sometimes been pretended, that the monopoly of this sort of foreign trade necessarily encourages smuggling. It has done so in several different ways, however, and has done so, I believe (and, upon all ordinary occasions, I am disposed to think that the evidence is very decisive), in the best manner possible.

The first of those ways, and by far, perhaps the most important, of which the monopoly of foreign commerce has given occasion to the corruption of morals among those colonies, is the easy access which it affording to the venality of the traders. It gives great encouragement, it has been pretended (and I think, upon all these circumstances, very probable), to the practice of smuggling. By means of it the colonists are enabled to carry their goods to distant markets, without being suspected, and without paying the freight or insurance. They are enabled to smugglesometimes, and not always, indeed; and when they are suspected, they are obliged to conceal themselves. The greater

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 255

part of the other taxes, therefore, would probably be levied at the expense of those colonies, which could afford neither a revenue to the mother state, nor a share in the common government of Europe. The greater part of the rest, however, might be so levied. In the colony of New York, for example, a stamp duty of two shillings and threepences a-page, is imposed every year, for paying certain duties which it imposes upon the colony produce. The colony produce, however, does very seldom exceed what pays the stamp-duty. It is otherwise with the tax of Maryland and Virginia; and though these are not, strictly speaking, provinces, because their assemblies are not under the immediate jurisdiction of Great- Britain; yet, by a sort of provincial congress, which they annually assemble in the capital city, they levy their own stamp duty upon the produce, and share it, with other colonies, with the produce of their inland navigations. The produce of their inland navigation is in this manner supposed to fall within the same tax-base as that of New York and North Carolina. In the different taxes which Great Britain imposes upon her own subjects, it is usual to distinguish three classes, of different rates, and different purposes; first, the land-duty of the sovereign, for supporting the civil and military establishments; secondly, the duties of customs and imposts; and, thirdly (and last of all) those of land, for paying those particular duties. In order to render the first of those taxes uniform, and to oblige every person, whether subject or subject-citizen, to pay the like tax with himself in every other parish and jurisdiction of the country; in order, too, that no person may evade or evade it as he can do the others; the sovereign has, in most cases (except upon particular circumstances), the sole right of collecting the taxes; he can impose them only upon those who send their returns; he can annul or vary those taxes as often, and as far, at his pleasure, and without any appeal from any tribunal of justice, but by an act which he can himself bring before that tribunal.

The sovereign, by taxing his own subject according 

The sovereign, again (by levYING his own subject according to his own fancy), might render the whole of his taxes either as uniform as those of any other civilized country, and as nearly as he could judge of equal importance to

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 256

his revenue, or as unequal as they could well be. The levying, in either case, would be as easy as that which is done by a particular set or orders of men over and above all the rest of their fellow subjects; and the subject of each individual, though not always his own, might always be his own. In the levying of his taxes, the sovereign could never have occasion to consult his ministers about the proportion of his taxes to the produce of every particular district, of which he might himself be the principal owner; but might have the whole produce, as it rose or fell, assessed, at his pleasure, upon the inhabitants, according to his own proper valuation.

In the levying of taxes upon particular branches of the public revenue, the great interest of every particular person, the interest which consists altogether, either in the revenue which he derives from some particular source, or, in consequence of the exemptions or drawbacks upon particular commodities, in that revenue which is not derived altogether from that particular, can never arise. The sovereign, indeed, may sometimes be obliged to do this, in order that the general interest of the society, or the public good, may not suffer too much from any particular tax; but it is always for his interest that this should never be done. If the general interest of the society is to be promoted, if it is to contribute something towards the support of the sovereign and the commonwealth, if, in consequence either either of the exemptions or the drawback, it should contribute towards defray the expense of the civil and military government of the society, the sovereign, as well as the rest, ought always to be able to afford it. If he is unable, he must content himself with the smallest possible reduction, and, in the end, the whole tax will be paid, not according to what the revenue ought to be, but according to what the revenue is likely to be.

In France, the kingdom, like most other parts 

The kingdom, like most other parts of Europe, derives its revenue, either, first from its land-tax (levying a part only upon the produce of the lands of the crown), or from its customs and excise (levying a part only upon the produce of the goods imported or exported, according to the duties of customs and excise, the revenue of which, in the present times is, perhaps, more properly considered as a revenue derived from a land-tax, than

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 257

as a revenue from any particular branch of the public revenue of the state; and, secondly, either, from the tithes and other ancient duties which were paid upon bread and ale; the one a very heavy duty, the latter not much heavier than what is at this day paid upon the wines of the Champagne), or, lastly, from the fees and annuITIES of the several towns and parishes which, though they have been reduced somewhat since the time when they had the highest authority, are still very considerable.
The king of England is, by his predecessors, the greatest landlord of Europe, and, in the present state of things (for it is a very changed one), he has not, perhaps (for I have no reason either to believe, nor to suspect that he does not), enjoyed, in the same manner, a greater share of that revenue, either as proprietor of the land which he governs, or, what comes to a still higher consideration (for I must observe here, too, that the rent of all lands in England is nowhere so high as in France), which belongs to the great lords, to the great proprietors of all the lands which are in cultivation, and which is supposed to amount at present, to upwards of L1500,000 a-year. In order, therefore, to support his authority and to maintain a force of troops, he must always draw upon him some part of that revenue; a revenue, which is generally, though not altogether always (for the officers and soldiers of a standing army are not all equal parsons, and there are many who are very rich), more than sufficient to maintain those forces. The expense which he has incurred, either in time or money in defending himself from foreign invasion, has, in all great monarchies, been a source of revenue to some of their principal lords. The French king has been particularly famous for his expense in that kind; and it is upon that account, probably (and it seems very likely), because it was the most expensive, that the war in which he was engaged was the shortest and best concluded. It cost the king, at an average of ten years, about L.1,000,000. During the whole of this time he had, at no one moment, either a regular army of his own, or a standing army of any other kind besides that of the king's body-guard, of the gendarme, and the four regiments of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 258

foot, under their respective regimental commanders. His person, too (for the state is supposed always more secure in the person who presides in person over a large and active executive power than in one who is only occasionally to exercise it), was guarded, not by a single sentry, but, as in a Roman camp or palace, by two sentries; and the night-duty of these sentries consisted altogether in the duty of seeing to it that no one else was in any part either in the house or in any part of the palace. The person of Augustus himself was never exposed, even in a public assembly, but either by day or night, in a room, which, in a modern monarchy, would be considered as too small for such great magnificence, or even by a window; or by some aperture which could be opened by only one hand. In a Roman palace there was always some guard, though not of the most formidable kind, to prevent a tumult from breaking out in a moment of passion, in the midst of the assembly of some very great personage. But though this magnificency, which is called magnificence in the Greek, had once been entirely established among the Romans, the republic itself could never have been ruined by it; for it was the interest of that great republic, to preserve, in spite of all its enemies, the greatest degree of liberty that was possible to a nation. The Roman people, accordingly, were never alarmed at the sight of a standing army, which they were always assured would soon return from its distant expedition, and which, in the meantime, they were allowed to keep in constant repair, under the command of a few soldiers, who had no right to command the army themselves. The armies of Rome never amounted, for any considerable time, either in numbers or expense, to a fourth or fifth part of the whole body-guards of every different city and town in Italy, and never made a considerable appearance either in war or in peace; because it was the interest both  of those cities and of themselves to prevent any disorder, which might arise from the excessive power and authority which such armies naturally assumed over them, when placed under their immediate command; or from their not being able to exercise that authority, in consequence either of their being improperly commanded, or of not being allowed to exercise that authority properly, or when properly commanded, but always at the will of those whose authority and power were supposed sufficient, and whose

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 259

authority was supposed sufficient to maintain that power.
The military establishments of ancient Greece and Rome had no such tendency. The great bodies of them never amounted either in number or in splendour, to any considerable proportion of the people. The soldiers who defended the city and the territory of each state were maintained by that state. Their pay was paid by the state, not in money, but in provisions; and the soldiers were maintained altogether at its expense. In the Greek wars, accordingly, those great armies, though they occasionally marched through hostile countries, never amounted, for any considerable time, either in numbers, or in expense, either to a fourth or to any greater part of the inhabitants of any of the different cities which they attacked. In the wars of Alexander, the Persian wars, the wars of the Macedonian and Greek nations, the Roman fleets seldom amounted either in number or in splendour to any considerable part either of the armies of either of those empires. They were all, or almost all, maintained by their respective sovereigns, at their own expense.
The commerce of the ancient Greeks and Romans consisted, first in a considerable inland commerce carried on by sea, and in a great variety and quantity of goods carried on by a considerable number of land-carriers; secondly, in a considerable coast-trade, in foreign goods, carried either by sea or by land, and exchanged for the manufactures, and the home commodities of the countries which lay round the Mediterranean sea, principally with the cities of the countries which lie along its banks; third, in some foreign trade of the colonies, carried on by means of merchants who resided in their own colonies, with the produce of their industry, and exchanged it for that of other European countries, particularly with the colonies which lay along the western and southern coasts, particularly in Brazil and Peru; fourth, and lastly, in some inland and coast-trade carried on by means both of the sea and by land, with the produce of American and African colonies. The inland and coast-trading powers of the ancient Greeks, as they were chiefly supported by their own subjects in those ancient times, so they are still, perhaps more or less in the different states of Europe; but in the most thriving of all they seem to have been altogether unsupported by them, or at least to be less supported. In those days the trade between the Mediterranean sea and Africa was carried on chiefly by slaves; in that between the Baltic and Adigean seas it

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 260

consisted principally in freemen, of whom the number amounted, it is said (according, it is supposed (I believe), to more than one-half of the whole number employed in the trade, of whom more than two thirds had no fixed abode but in the ship which sailed from the Mediterranean to the African coast. This great variety in the circumstances and situation both of the masters and sailors of those ships, must have been sufficient, even in those times, to give every man some interest to endeavour, as much at his own ease as he could, either to improve the ship, to improve himself, or at least not to ruin the ship which belonged to him. The master of such a merchant ship was, in this manner necessarily, interested to improve his cargo, to improve the condition and situation both 



 


The master of a slave ship, however, was not so necessarily bound to do any of those things. The slave ship was not always bound to carry out the cargo of the merchant, who was, for the most important part of his business in the slave trade, obliged, in order to save her from destruction, to employ the master's crew. In the slave trade the master was generally the only merchant; the sailors were the workpeople whom he employed, and the cargo of the ship which they sailed on, and in which, in most cases, he sailed too, was his own. In the slave trade the master was generally, indeed (it was not so much because the master had no fixed abode in Africa, as because the nature of the trade obliged him, for want of better ships, to employ the crew which came to him in his own vessels, as the greater part of them being slaves of his own, he might be disposed to neglect the care and maintenance of them. The cargo which he sailed upon was generally the property of himself, of some other master, who had given a security for the payment, either of a large sum of money, or, what would give him more security, a certain portion either of his revenue, or of the goods which were purchased by the cargo, or of some part of them, in exchange for those revenue, goods of which the market was generally supplied by merchants of the merchant ship which sailed with the cargo. The master who sailed in the master ship, therefore (for in the master ship, too, there is always a considerable number of sailors who belong to the master who sails

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 261

it), could have his share of the goods of all his crew, provided he himself was a sailor; but he could not, for any considerable time, enjoy it. The goods of all other sailors were, by the laws which at that time made this distinction, subject both to his inspection and to that of the master of the ship. But if any of them happened to sell below his price, he was liable to have it confiscated and forfeited. The law, therefore, endeavoured, by all these regulations, to prevent the rich merchant from being able to enrich his own servants by the cheapness of his goods. It did not attempt to prevent the poor man from being able either, either, to sell cheaper than he bought, or to be able to purchase, with his savings, the same quantity either of corn, or of other provisions, which, without the intervention either of the rich merchant, of whom he was always a competitor, or of the poor merchant who was always an ally, he might otherwise have purchased with his profits; because, as the poor merchant, too, was always an enemy, the one against the other, the one could not well be much affected by any regulation which tended either, either, to increase, or to diminish, either the quantity, or the profits, either of his own servants, or of the poor sailors whom, in the ordinary state, he was bound, for the honour and protection of his own person, either to educate, or, more properly, not to instruct; because, in the former case, the children would soon be grown up to take their places in the latter. In this state of society, however, it was thought, it might be reasonable, that some of the advantages which the poor might gain by the cheap sale of the commodities, should, for a limited time at least (and not, I believe for ever), go to the advantage of those who had the advantage of selling them.

The natural distribution, both of stock, and, more particularly, of land-rents among different orders of men, has its origin in this original inequality of fortune, which, in consequence of this inequality, is continually diminishing. It arises, first from this original inequality of fortune: and secondly, and last of all from the inequality of condition.

First of all, the original inequalities in fortune must have their origin, not so much from the nature of things, as from the constitution of human nature.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 262

The inequality in riches and poverty, which naturally arises from the inequalities in the productive powers of labour and stock, is, in this case, altogether of a piece, arising either directly from those original inequalities in fortune, or from other causes which may, perhaps be more proper to consider.
The inequality in riches and poverty arises, first, from a defect in that constitution which naturally establishes the superiority of some over others in the social state; and which necessarily introduces, too (for the sake both  of security and happiness), the superiority either of wealth or of birth; and secondly from the nature of human affairs, which, by means both of natural causes and human institutions (which, however, are all of them imperfect), necessarily introduce the inequality of fortune.

A defect in that natural or original distribution of wealth, is everywhere the cause, and not the effect of the inequality which necessarily follows it. The inequality of birth, on the other hand, arises directly from that original distribution of riches, and is therefore the effect, not of any defect in the nature of things, but rather of that original distribution itself, of its having taken place, not according to what is natural and essential, as it ought naturally to have taken place, but rather according to what, from some cause or other, has been rendered somewhat irregular or extraneous. It necessarily arises from that inequality of birth which is founded, not upon any defect in nature, but upon a certain institution, the institution of slavery; and it cannot arise but in consequence of that inequality in which the children of slaves, though they should be free, yet because their parents, though they were their masters, should be themselves their bondmen and slaves, their situation, like that in the poorest and most barbarous societies of the ancients, must, for their own protection and security, be very precarious and insecure; a situation which cannot well last long, but, like that of the poor of ancient Greece and Italy before the Trojan war, must soon be reduced to beggary and ruin.
3. The inequality arising from other causes, is, accordingly, of a different kind from this inequality of birth.

It is not the natural or essential distribution of stock and labour, but the distribution which is made by human institutions, according as the different situations of individuals render them, either, either, more, or less likely either to be employments, to be owners of property, or, in general, to contribute towards supporting

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 263

the society. It was thus, that in every country where there is a considerable degree of opulence, the greater the extent of land which a great proprietor possesses, the less will naturally be the number of labourers who work upon it. In the countries where the law gives great security, as at Venice, Genoa and Hamburg; the law, in order to render such persons as safe as possible in their possessions, makes the whole territory of the state, and the greater part of that which lies under the dominion either of a vassal or a subject of a foreign prince, pass in succession through the hands of a single person. This person, though he has no immediate interest, has no scruple about giving up to another his right of primacy in some particular trade or profession, upon such conditions, however (as the circumstances of each particular trade or profession may admit), that if the trade, after a reasonable time, should become too troublesome, the trade which succeeds to his own, shall be free to all the children of the family, without any regard either to the age at whose death the right shall pass, or the fortune at whose birth. The right, therefore, passes in succession through a small number, who have no scrupulously scrupulous regard for the rights, interests, and fortunes of the greater part of their immediate predecessors. The same cause which naturally establishes the opulence and security of such countries, renders it, in general, difficult to form small trading republics. The inhabitants of those small states naturally endeavour to acquire the whole of what they can by trade; and though, in order to acquire it altogether, they are frequently exposed to the violence, injustice and injustice of their fellow-citizens, they generally find that, in the end, they are secure in the possession of what they have, and are at no great loss in the pursuit of what is still farther to come. Such republic, therefore, though it has its share of 


Page headings: Cape Finisterre, cause of the opulence of the Dutch settlements in that country;  Colonie of New Zealand, causes that colony to flourish and prosper;  Holland, cause of that country being the richest country in the north part of Europe]

 THE WEAL Of Nations, PG 263-265 The inhabitants of those small states necessarily endeavour to acquire the entire produce of their industry, by employing as many people as possible in cultivating the lands which are fit for

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 264

producing that produce. The number of hands in the cultivation of a great empire, on the contrary, can seldom exceed what is necessary for supplying the consumption either of that particular person or class of people who possess that empire, and who, in order to supply that particular consumption themselves, require but a small number of hands to manage them; for the same reason, perhaps, that it seldom happens to be more than two or three per cent. over-traded in the European markets; for though a great deal is annually exported to foreign countries, very little is brought back to the mother-country for immediate use or consumption. The greater the extent of such an extensive empire as that which the Netherlands enjoy, therefore (for that country, too, has been very much enlarged since they first enjoyed their independence), the less must the cultivators of the lands which surround it have to content themselves either in raising the produce themselves, of the rude produce, or of the manufactured commodities, of which those rude produce is a part; or in purchasing the manufactures, the goods of merchants, artificers and manufacturers, which the commerce of those other merchants, and even that of some of the inhabitants themselves (for those merchants, and some of the inhabitants themselves too, are artificers, manufacturers, and merchants), carry home with them to the mother-country. The inhabitants of such a great empire, consequently, can always afford a very great price for every part either

The inhabitants, therefore (for those colonies are, in reality, settlements of proprietor and farmer, of merchants, artificers and manufacturers), are necessarily obliged, either to raise the whole produce themselves, of the rude and manufactured produce, in order to furnish the consumable goods which the commerce of the country produces at home, and which it can never afford, or to buy such consumables with a part, or even with a very great portion,

The colonies are naturally, too (though, perhaps not altogether so naturally), endeavouring to increase the quantity of all those parts, of which the consumption at the time of their establishment is either insufficient, or not suited, either to their own particular circumstances or those of the mother country. In order to supply them both, they must, in many instances (which will be explained hereafter), purchase with a part of this surplus produce the produce of other colonies, and with that of a still greater quantity import from foreign countries such consumable commodities as are fit for immediate consumption in the colonies themselves.

The colony produce may, in this case too, exceed the consumption of the mother country. It can do so, in the same manner, only by augmenting somewhat more, and, therefore, not so much by a greater, but by an equal or smaller proportion, both those portions of the produce which are over and above their proper proportion, and those portions which are under it; and, therefore, by a still greater augment of the one, than of the other, or, what comes to the like thing, by an equal or less augmentation of the price.

In the course of a century, therefore, the produce of a single English plantation, if we compare the present times with that of the late war (the commencement, I believe, of the present century), may exceed the consumption both, either of the mother country, or even of the most thriving colony, of Holland. But if we consider that produce, when compared with that which was produced by a hundred Dutch colonies in the same situation, we must find that the English plantation produces more than three times the quantity of the surplus produce, or of what the most thriving of those colonies could afford, and that Dutch colony, instead, produces about one-third more. The English colony is therefore, in the present state of its industry and commerce, superior to that of Holland,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 266

though the Dutch colonies are certainly superior to any other nation in Europe. The policy of the mother-country seems, upon the whole, favourable, to the prosperity and extension of the colonies.

In consequence of the establishment of this system, England, it has been pretended, is not only the great manufacturer of Europe; but that, notwithstanding her superiority in manufactures, her colonies are in many respects inferior to the greater part of them; and that, in the progress of improvement and population, their manufactures, too (which, it has been said, have not advanced to any considerable height in the present century), are likely to follow the example of England. The policy, it must be acknowledged (though it has not hitherto been fully explained) seems to favour agriculture much more than manufactures, though in reality it favourers neither of them more nor less. It has given a considerable advantage both in foreign, and in domestic trade to the English colonies; a superiority which they, no doubt, would still have enjoyed, but for this policy, and in the same manner, if the policy had not been established by a different set  of merchants. The colony trade, however, as I have already observed in the fourth of the three reasons above assigned, though it has, upon the whole, afforded a very great advantage to Great England, has been, perhaps, more hurt by it than benefited by any other nation in the commercial history of the earth. The trade of the colonies, it has been said, is not only disadvantageous to the countries in which it is established, but advantageous only, in proportion as it is advantageous to those in whose favor the trade is granted; in other words, as the countries in favour of which the trade happens to happen, happen to have the greatest demand, and consequently the most advantageous rate of profit, in proportion to what they are likely, in the long-term, to pay for it; or as the trade in which the colonies trade for their own advantage, tends, so far as it can be made to do, either to raise their rate of profit higher, or to sink theirs lower. This doctrine, however (according to which Great Britain derives a real advantage from a colony trade which is not advantageous to her), though not founded on a particular observation or experience, seems, in the present state, to have gained general currency through the whole of the English and Irish colonies.

I answer, That this doctrine is not founded on a single

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 267

authority or principle, but is, on every hand, contrary to the plainest reason and experience; and if it had any foundation, would have rendered the granting of bounties altogether ineffectuous, or rather, in many cases altogether criminal. The bounties, it has been said by some authors, have been frequently abused. This is a manifest mistake, and a manifest injustice. It is a mistake, not because it suppositions, what in reality cannot be supported, that any bounty, whatever may have been its motive or object, could have been misused; but because it supposes, what in fact cannot be supported either, that the abuse could have arisen from any defect of discretion in the person who gave the order; that it could arise from the negligence or ignorance of the person who was to receive the bounty, or from the wantonness or profusion of the person who granted it; that the abuse could arise either from the person himself, who, being too careless in the performance of his duty; or, from his immediate superior, who was to take the bounty from him; from the one circumstance being the fault of the person himself; and from the latter, being the fault either of the order to which he belonged, or of some other power that was interested in the preservation or increase of the revenue which that revenue supported; but that the abuse could arise, not from the person who gave the bounty, or from the order to which that person belonged; but, on the other hand from that other power which, it supposes, was interested to preserve or augment the revenue which that revenue maintained; from this other circumstance arising, not from any defect of discretion in the order, but, from its being altogether unconnected with either of those circumstances.

Bounties, besides, have sometimes been granted without any such defects in the order or superior which granted them; and bounties have frequently been withdrawn, without either any such defect, nor even any such wanton profusion, in consequence of such defects. In 1722 and 1723, for instance, bounties were granted to the East India companies, for establishing in the island provinces of Indostan a regular administration, with all necessary officers, warehouses and provisions, for the transportation of their surplus corn. The administration of those colonies was, it was pretended by those gentlemen who gave the bountIES, not only perfectly well managed; and yet the whole expense was, they pretended, laid out upon

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 268

the interest only, and upon the interest only only, without taking any share of the profits. It is thus that we must judge of the real state of their finances, in comparison with those of the most opulent nations of Europe.

The exorbitant profits of stock employed as a revenue to maintain unproductive labours are the natural effect of such a policy. They raise, therefore, both rent and profit higher than they otherwise would be. The rent, or what is paid for this use and occupancy of the land, is the original foundation of both the wages of labour and the profits which are the immediate consequence of that wages and profit; and if the original fund, which originally supported them both, were to go away in consequence of such a policy, they would be replaced, in a still greater proportion, with a still greater rent.

The severity of the laws, therefore (I have already endeavoured to shew), against the exorbitance, not so much of wages and profits, as against the importation of wool, must necessarily have been, not so much an effect of those two circumstances, as of some other more fundamental one, of the want of sufficient funds to support the labour and industry which were maintained there.

It has already been shown that the bounty on the importation of wool, and the prohibition of its exportation, had no such tendency, either to raise, as to lower the price of that commodity, as the high profits of stock employed in raising, or the great quantity of that stock employed in the improvement and cultivation of land might otherwise have afforded. The bounty, besides (for the encouragement given by it was very limited), was not extended to Scotland, or to the plantations of America, which, in consequence of the union of the colonies there in 1764 (which took away the exclusive trade of the English East India company, and established a free commerce between the different British possessions there), were enabled to sell at all the same high prices at which English wool is sold in England; at least in the wool of which they have the management. The importation into Scotland of wool was not prohibited by the Union, but subject only, it is said, to a small duty, which, it was supposed, was not worth the taking. But in the wool of North America the whole produce of the colonies was subjected, it is said, to the like small duty, and was there sold for as high a price at the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 269

market as in England.

It was in consequence, therefore, of these restraints, says Mr Hume,[30] and as they tended to lower the value, or rather the quantity of North America goods exported, they must necessarily have tended, more than any other, to raise the value, or rather to keep the same value, of those exported from other parts  Of all the restraints which the mother country has imposed upon the trade of its own colonies, none seems so effectually to restrain it from over-trading in proportion as this small tax of three shillings and fourpence the hundredweight, or about twentypence sterling a hundredweight, is said to have been in the case.

The same causes that raised the price of wool in North American colonies, must, it has been supposed, have lowered that of raw silk in Great Bengal, or from thence carried it to the Mediterranean and West Indies; the greater part of the surplus produce being destined for foreign consumption. This conclusion seems, however (though perhaps not very probably) true. It is, however (for reasons already assigned), altogether insufficient for establishing that monopoly which is so just and necessary in the case of the trade to America. It may, perhaps, however, with some safety, be asserted, as a maxim of general policy; that whatever raises the price of one commodity above that which would otherwise rise, must raise that also of another; that is to say the wages of the labourers in one employment must necessarily be higher, the profits and rent of the stock in that employment, and consequently the real revenue and subsistence of those labourer and owner, must necessarily, more than ever, rise, in consequence of this rise in the price.

The restraints which the British government have imposed upon the inland trade of its own colonies, seem to be equally effectual for restraining that trade, either in its progress towards the Mediterranean or in its declension towards the West Indies, from over-exporting to the extent which, according 




The tax of three shillINGS and four pence the ton upon all goods exported from North America to any foreign market is supposed to have been the original source of this high rate of interest. It seems not to be much inferior to the old stamp duties upon the renewal of mortgages; and it has continued to take its course, without any considerable interruption, from one end to another of our North American settlements, and from the beginning of our

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 270

British colonies, up to the present. The price of the best English woollens, therefore, is, during these twenty or five-year intervals, continually declining.
The same regulations have, at the same time (1767, and again 1769), put a stop, for about two years, to the importation of all French wool, except that of the greater portion of its growth. France was, before these times, our most important foreign market for this article; and it is not very probable that the high price which this regulation has raised, will be fully compensated by the diminuation of the quantity which can be imported into Great Britain. It has raised the price in the East of England somewhat more than half; and in the North of England somewhat less; that is to say, the price in both places is said to have been about four shilling pounds, or L.2.50 : 13 : 8d. higher, at present, and a good many shillings cheaper at the end of those two periods, than it was at the beginning. In 1768, the importations were still more restrained; in 1769 they were again restrained, for about six months, only, to the greater portion of French wool.

These high duties upon the re-importation of wool have, upon several different accounts, contributed to sink somewhat the value even of that commodity, which, though it is not a component part of the rude produce of land which is destined for immediate consumption, is nevertheless, considered by all men of common sense as a necessary instrument of domestic life and furniture.

The price, both of raw hides and of wool, has been, for some time past, much lower, both in Great Britain and Ireland than at about the same period, I believe (1763, 1766), or even about the middle of the last century, and it is now, I believe, somewhat higher, perhaps somewhat nearer the middle than it was then. This change, too, has been brought about by the regulations, of which the object, as they were first enacted, seems to have had but a small part of the object which it has afterwards acquired; that is, it has principally been owing to an increasing demand from the growing and knitting trade of Great Britain, and a diminishing demand from that of Ireland and the plantations; a demand which the high duties of 1763, 1764 and 1765 did very little either to increase or to

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 271

diminish. The exportation, however, which has hitherto been allowed, though subject to some duties of customs, yet, for reasons which I shall hereafter explain more fully, has been subjected, in most cases, to no duties at all.


Thirdly and lastly, Those regulations have been imposed with a good intention. They have endeavoured to remedy, as far at any time as possible, what was said to be a very grievous wrong. The wool of England, it was supposed (and I think I may say with great probability), was frequently imported, and in many different ways, in order to be exported, without being first sent thither, and, consequently without paying any duties. This abuse was, upon many occasions, committed with such frequency, and in so many different places, as to give great offence, and to afford some pretext, perhaps even to the suspicion, that the whole wool market was frequently understocking in the home country. By the 8th and 9th Geo. III. c. 21, it was declared lawful for English wool to be exported, not only subject to some duties of custom, but without any duty at all. It has accordingly been exported with great advantage, both in the shape  Of wools and raw hides; and, notwithstanding this declaration, the great demand from the growing and knitting trade, which, in consequence of the greater improvement of the country, has been increasing very fast, has, notwithstanding these regulations, not yet been entirely supplied. The greater part, perhaps, of that demand still continues unsupplied; and the high duties of 1763 and 1765 still hinder the greater portion of that demand, even from going abroad. In consequence of the foregoing, therefore (though not the most important part), those regulations seem to be working towards their object very much better, than if the greater part of that market was not yet completely supplied. But though, by means of them, Great Britain may, for a short time, have some advantage over other nations; yet it is evident, that, for the future, the greater portion of her demand, and consequently the greater quantity of wool, will probably be, and, I believe, will already be, supplied from foreign markets, more nearly in proportion to their demand, and less from her own.
The prohibition against the importation of foreign woollens and raw hides has, in this manner, been carried farther than the old statute would allow.
The

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 272

exportation, either by the high-road, or by a canal or highway through the remotest parts of it, must always be regulated by a particular licence, granted by the king's commissioners for granting those licences.

In the trade to which the inland navigation belongs, it is otherwise. It is free to all nations, who pay no duties, except such as are paid upon such exportation of corn as may be necessary in consequence of the scarcity of the seasons. But the inland navigation, by subjecting all the different parts of a great kingdom, which lie round the Mediterranean and Baltic seas to the arbitrary will of a few private adventurers, imposes a real tax, not only upon the whole kingdom, or even of a considerable part of it; but sometimes upon a great part, or even of the greater part of particular provinces or districts.

In the trade to which that of the merchants and master manufacturers of London is confined (which is commonly, I believe the greater part of it), it seems not improbable that a certain portion of their capital might frequently, and for some considerable time together (for the same reason that it sometimes happens in other branches of trade), be employed in the maintenance of the inland navigation of the kingdom, and in that of its different navigations and canal-ways, of which those which are carried upon British soil are the principal ones. In this case, however, the whole capital would necessarily be withdrawn from that of the greater part, of which it would then be distributed among a smaller number.

The exportation of all goods of home growth, either of Europe or of America, is prohibited by an order in council, which has given occasion, I believe, to this extraordinary restriction of the inland commerce of Great

• CHAP II. -OF THE IMPLEMENTS OF THE CAPITALS OF BRITAIN, OF THE FLEET STATIONED AT BURLINGTON, AND OVERSEAS.


The capital of the great body of people in any country naturally seeks the employment most advantageous, and which, being paid in the most direct and easiest manner, will give them the greatest return. It naturally follows, therefore, that capital naturally gravitates to that employment, which affords it the most advantageous, the returns of the greatest value, and at the greatest distance from other employMENTS, and which can best afford the means both to acquire that valuable produce,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 273

as fast as it can be made, as cheap as it is made.

In every society, the most advantageous employments must necessarily attract capital. The capital of every society, however, is necessarily divided between different employments, and must maintain a certain number, or a certain number and proportion of productive labourers, who are maintained in those employments, either directly by the revenue arising from those who contribute to the public revenue, or indirectly through the intervention of some of their superiors.

The exportation of rude produce necessarily subjects every country, which exports it, either to the duty or prohibition of the customs, to the vexations, inconveniencies, and burdens of the customs. It necessarily subject's the whole country, however, not only in the one way only, but in all three of the above-mentioned ways; first by rendering that part of it which exports it subject to a double burden, of the customs, of which it must pay a duty, secondly by excluding it from the market, or from being imported by foreigners; and thirdly, by subjecting that part which imports such goods from such countries to the like double burdens of the duties of customs and of exorbitant duties. It is upon the second and third of those three accounts that, in every country which has any share in the production either of rude or manufactured produce, it seems natural, that the most advantageous employments should attract to themselves the greatest capital, and that capital, too should naturally gravitate to those most advantageous employments, without being hindered or restrained in any respect from doing so, by the laws or regulations of the country. In every country, therefore, the more advantageous, the cheaper, the better the produce of every particular branch of industry, so far as it depends upon the exchangeable value, the more likely that capital, which employs it, should attract to itself the greatest possible capital, or the greatest possible quantity and kind, either of land or labour.

In every society which is not engaged, directly or indirectly, either directly or indirectly in the rude or manufacturing productions of which the exchange is made between other societies, the exorbitant profits of stock must necessarily attract a greater proportion of the capital of those other countries, and must, consequently the less likely that capital to remain within the particular country, and to attract capital to itself, the most advantageous employment in it.


 CHAP II.


Of those Circumstance which naturally

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 274

lead to this degradation of price. Of such as are occasioned either altogether or in a great measure by natural accidents, such as those which sometimes raise or lower the wages of common labour; such as what happen to take place at sea and upon the high seas, in mines, in quarried stones and in waste lands. The natural price of labour is naturally regulated according to this natural law of its subsistence; according to its utility and the number and quality of the workmen who can be procured for it. The demand for it, therefore, naturally regulates that of the labouring classes, who are always in want of the workmen who are capable of performing it, or of the money which pays them.
The demand for manufactures, on contrary, arises altogether, and not altogether, from natural causes. They are made only in consequence, or rather because of, certain circumstances in the country in which the business happens to be transacted. They may be carried to any distant market, but they cannot be carried to a distant market without first having been made there; and it requires an immense capital to carry any considerable part 

The price of manufactures, therefore, must always bear a great proportion, not so very different in its nature from the rent of land, to what the demand is supposed to require. It rises, therefore, not in proportion, as that of land, but rather in an opposite manner. The quantity of silver annually imported into any country, it has already shewn, must necessarily be much more in proportion to the annual consumption, than the annual importation of manufactures, or the value of their final sale, will admit of; because the former is limited by the annual produce of the lands of that particular country, and by that only; the second, by the annual consumption in other countries; and the demand of all other countries being continually increasing.

The price, on the contrary, must always bear a much greater proportion, it is evident enough, to the actual demand. It rises, accordingly, not in proportion as the quantity of silver annually imported increases; but in an opposite manner; and in the proportion of its absolute value. The greater the quantity, the less the price, and the smaller, too, the quantity of the precious metals which can ever be brought into competition in any country.
The demand of every particular country, therefore (for it is impossible, it has been shown in the first book, that any general rule can be

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 275

established for all), must be determined by the actual circumstances which that country is going through at that particular time; and the interest which that country is likely to have for its annual produce of land must, as nearly as possible coincide in all the variations in those circumstances, either in the rate of cultivation, in that of the annual crop, or both together. The rent which a proprietor derives from the use and occupancy of his land is, no doubt, in this manner necessarily regulated by all these circumstances. The rent, however (it is said by the ingenious Mr Hume), is commonly so very different from what it really is, that, when the tenant pays it, he is really giving up to the proprietor the whole value of his annual produce; because, though it may be supposed that he gets back a good deal less, it really is more than he gives up.


 CHAP II.

OF RENTS OF STOCK, AND OF LANDLORD' S PROPERTY. 


 Rent is everywhere a real consideration of the value which must, for the purposes of human life, be given up to a thing, and of the proportion which this thing must bear to other things of equal value, or even of other things of much higher value.
The proportion, indeed (for it can never exceed one) in which any thing ought to bear to other things of equal value is not altogether so fixed as the value of the thing which is in dispute; because, when two persons have equal stock in a common stockyard, the value which each ought, in common with all other men, to give for the stock of the other may be different in different situations; and the owner of a great estate, though, perhaps, in a very poor state of improvement and cultivation, may, at the same time, possess a great quantity both in stock and estate, and may, consequently, be in some degree in competition with many other rich people. But whatever the proportion between two things is, in any situation, it must necessarily regulate the value which ought, in every other situation (for it can be nowhere otherwise than everywhere), to be given for either.

In the political economy of nations the proportion between stock, and landlord's property is, perhaps (for the same reasons which have given occasion to this division into three books of this kind), the principal consideration.

The proportion between them regulates, first, what may be called, the rent

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 276

or profit of land; and secondly, what may be called the wages and subsistence of labour.

In a free trade, the merchants and manufacturers, it has already been observed, are the productive labourers, who, by exchanging the produce, either immediately or in the course of a few days or weeks, contribute to the annual production of some quantity of manufactured commodities. The rent of the lands which they inhabit, is, as it always is, the price paid for their useful services. The price which they pay to their landlord for this use and occupancy, constitutes the profit of their employer, who employs them in supplying the demand, either immediately, or, more probably in the course, of several months or years, afterwards, either by wholesale, retail or the home trade. It constitutes the whole of the price or wages of their employment.

The rent of land is the price paid by those whose labour produces nothing. The profits of stock, on account of their being distributed among a greater number of people, constitute the rent of land which, they themselves consume or employ. The wages, therefore, of the greater part, or, what is the same thing with their profits, of all the labour which is employed upon land and in other instruments and means of commerce, are, in this system, altogether a revenue arising from unproductive labourer labour only, which, as it affords no revenue or interest to its own proprietor or owner (the merchants and manufacturers), so it can have none either towards supporting the productive labourers who labour upon land, nor towards maintaining the productive labourers whom they maintain.

In the political economy of the French agricultural class, the artificers, tailors, weavers and weaver's servants, are all considered as unprosperous, because they do not afford any revenue, or even any interest to the landlords, farmers and country gentlemen, to whom their employment belongs, but are employed altogether as productive labour, and are, therefore, the sole fund which can maintain, either immediately, in the shape either of rent or of profit, that unproductive labour which produces neither revenue nor interest. The rent, profit and interest of artificers are considered as the three different parts of rent, and as the different portions, or, as they would probably say themselves, portions, of this rent or of this profit.


 CHAPTER II

Of Rent, Profit and Expense, and how those three different Parts are

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 277

derived from the Produced Stock of the society, or of the particular Persons who manage and direct it, and of the manner of their combining and distributing the Produce among the various Persons of whom it belongs, or into the various Classes of which they compose a part.

The stock, which is employed for the purposes of revenue, must necessarily belong either, first, to one of those three different classes of people, who, in proportion to the produce or value of the annual produce of the lands and labour of their respective countries, enjoy a greater or less degree of luxury, or wealth and greatness, and consequently of authority and respect, and, consequently, of power; secondly to one of the three foregoing, who, in proportion as that annual produce falls short of the demand for that sort of rude produce, suffers a greater or less degree of distress, and is in want of something to eat; or, thirdly, to one or other of the two foregoing, and in the same proportion, suffers distress, but in want of something to wear. The profits of stock are the wages, or the value which is paid for this authority and respect, and the rent of land the wages, which, in the price or exchangeable value, is given to the landlord for that part, or for that part only of his produce, which he himself either enjoys or produces.
30. Profit arises in the same way as rent in all the different parts, both of which must always be ultimately drawn from the produce, and not from some extraneous cause. The person who derives the one must always have derived the other.

Rent, indeed arises partly, not from any intrinsic value in the rude materials, of which the land produces them; partly from a monopoly granted by law to some particular persons, for example, to the occupiers or cultivators of a certain portion of the land of the society, for a term not exceeding the term during which they can possess the same, or a greater share of that land; but partly, too from the enhancement, by means of improved cultivation, of that intrinsic value, by diminishing, as much as possible, the competition, either in price or in quality of the produce, and thereby enabling the occupiers or cultivator of this particular portion to raise their rents much higher, and consequently to command a greater share, either in the whole, or in some part, even of the produce of that particular portion. In every particular country

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 278

there is always a particular market, in which a part of the produce of land can be exchanged for a part either either either or both of the necessaries or luxuries which it affords. The landlord, farmer and manufacturer are all interested, either directly or indirectly, to open that particular branch of the general market to the produce of their particular lands; and they have all an interest in seeing it as little as possible burdened with any superfluities of this kind.

It is the interest of the manufacturer to keep as much stock as possible at his workhouse, and to employ that stock only in those particular branches of his business, in which he judges it will have the best chance of being profitable. The interest, on the other hand, of the landlord, of the merchant and of the farmer, is, in this case, precisely the opposite, and is, in most cases, exactly the same. The greater the number of competitors in the home market, the more they will bid against one another, in order to get possession either of the home-made goods which have been purchased with the surplus of the home consumption, or of those which had before come into competition with those made with that surplus. The interest of the farmer is exactly the same as that of the manufacturer; and it is his interest not to raise the price of his own rude produce above the lowest price which the market can bear, in order that it may be as cheap as that produce can be made at the expense of his labour and stock. The interest, on the contrary, of the manufacturer is exactly the same as that 


 

 The interest of the merchant, too is precisely the same with the interest of that of the farmer; and he has an interest, in the same manner as he has an interest in all other cases, either to buy as cheap as possible all the goods which are brought to market by the industry of other men, in order to make a profit of his own upon the whole value which he pays, whether by the sale of his own goods, by the purchase of other men s goods, by whatever means, he judges it will be for the best, or by what is commonly called the shipping and freight, or the insurance and delivery, of his own goods. He will always be more justly rewarded for the good conduct, both of the one sort, and of the other, than for any other part either of this capital, or of the stock or

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 279

stock of which he has the management, even though that stock were not itself a part either of the landed or of mercantile capital. He has the management, and he must necessarily have the interest to do all in its power, to increase its value. But if it is increased only through the increase, and not in any other way, than in this increase, it will always be increased by a greater quantity of labour than what would have gone to it had it been left alone, but without increasing the real revenue of its proprietors, and consequently the real wealth and revenue of their country, or of its inhabitants.
The same capital, it may be thought by some, can always, or very easily, be employed in both sorts of agriculture, provided it has the proper direction. But if it is employed in one sort of agriculture more advantageously than in the others, and provided the land is improved and cultivated in such a manner as to produce the most abundant, cheapest, and most abundant crops as possible; if it employs the labour and capital, too (for the interest of the landlord is the same with that 


L.1 The land, in the improved state of cultivation, can afford to the farmer the whole of the produce, or the value of his land, at least in the year immediately preceding the crop.

L.2 In the rude state of cultivation, the farmer can afford to employ no more capital in raising food for man than what will keep up, in a year, the number of labourers which he can employ in that particular sort or species of work; and he is, therefore, under the obligation to let every thing fall where it will, and is, therefore, in a worse condition, than in that rude condition. But the quantity of the annual produce of land, in the improved and cultivated state of its cultivation, is much less in proportion to its value in the former state, and to its number in the later state, than it was before the improvement of the country was advanced, and can, therefore, in both these states be employed much better and in greater abundance in the one way than in the latter.
3. Conclusion. The superiority of the productive powers, or of what may properly be termed the industry, of those who have landed property over that of their neighbours who have neither landed property nor any capital whatever, seems evidently to depend upon the superior value of the rude produce of their land, or upon

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 280

what is immediately produced by its cultivation. The labour which a labourer can perform, when he has land sufficient for the support of his family, is in proportion to the quantity of this produce which he is capable of producing. It can never, therefore, exceed the value which the land affording this labour is supposed to contain. The value which a capital adds to this produce, over-balances the value that labour affixes to it; so as to enable him, with a small additional quantity of it (the price of a servant, for example), either to cultivate more land, or to make a greater profit from the sale of a greater stock of goods.

The superiority of the productive powers, or of the labour which a capital affords over that which labour employs as a means of subsistence, depends upon the same causes, and necessarily follows from the same principles as that equality of fortune, or that inequality of fortune, which, as we learn from the experience of all nations who have ever been successful, occasions the most decisive victory over the inferior rank and species in every civilised society.

It is because wealth and fortune, though in their nature unequal and uncertain, can always, in the actual state in which things happen to stand (for they are, no doubt, in every particular instance, very different from one another), be brought under some certain rule of analogy, that, though they may sometimes happen, and sometimes may not, to fall in the same degree, the same persons may, and often can, possess great riches and considerable fortune, while the poor, and even many rich people may, and frequently do possess very little, or none at all. The person who, in a state of things, is both a labourer and a farmer (or a master of a family), possesses, as it were in common with other people, the whole of the riches of the world. But he can, in the actual circumstances of the times, possess nothing but what is sufficient to maintain himself as a labourers labourer and a farmer; or, in other words, the ordinary quantity of provisions which a labourer or a husbandman can afford to his family. The rich, on the other side, can, in the same circumstances, possess nothing but the scanty, the insufficient quantity of the necessaries of life; the few pieces of plate, and the trinkets of fashion, which are the effects of luxury, and not the cause of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 281

it. The labouring poor, by their industry, acquire the means of procuring those necessaries; they are the carriers of them to their employers. The employers in turn purchase them, and give employment and subsistence to those who bring them from the field, or the shop, or wherever they happen to come from. Their industry, therefore, not only adds something to their own revenue, and makes a fund for maintaining them while it is employed, but, by augmenting that of all their fellow-citizens, it necessarily tends, over and beyond all those purposes which it itself carries on within its proper sphere, to increase the whole national capital of the country.
The increase of the funds which are destined either for the maintenance of the productive labourer, for the payment of his wages, and, consequently, for the maintenance of the owners of stock employed in his service; the fund destined, in the first instance at least, for replacing, in a more or less accelerated manner, the stock of every individual, is evidently the effect of his industry. The increase of this fund, however, is necessarily slow in its progress through every different rank of society. The owner of the great iron forge, for example, cannot employ his entire stock at once in that service; he must wait for a part, or, what comes to nearly the same thing, for a very large portion, of it to come to him from some other employment; the workmen who are employed in it not being the owners of the whole stock employed in it. His industry does not immediately add, therefore, to his own capital, or increase the fund destined either to replace, or to maintain, the owner of this great forge. He has leisure enough, therefore, both to think of what may be done with his own stock, and, if it be a great sum, to acquire that capital, in order to carry it on with a profit; or to make, in the course of the year, what may be called a capital by capital, of what is his own. In the mean time, his workmen, who were originally his tenants or work-people (for he was the undertaker or employer of the greater part), have their wages, which are his stock reserved for their maintenance, and the profits of his work, or what he can make by them. The owner, therefore, cannot, immediately after the working of his forge, spend the whole of his whole capital, and thereby immediately add

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 282

to his capital a value of L.1000; he must wait for a long time before he can afford to employ that capital, which is continually increasing in value, and which he cannot afford either immediately to add to himself immediately, or in the mean while. The value of that part of his capital which is employed immediately, and immediately adds to his capital a value equal, or very near to an equivalent value, is the value, not only of what was spent upon the working, but of all the materials which were consumed and consumed in the making of that part of it, as well, as of all those which were employed afterwards in its preparation, as they are all continually increasing in their respective values, or very near to their respective values, and which must be gradually added to, and consumed in its preparation, till it becomes altogether consumed. The owner of that part of his capital, therefore, who, immediately before the beginning, employed the value, both real, as well, and imaginary (which are synonymous terms in political economy), of what had been spent in the working, must, after it has been completely spent, and replaced by the same quantity of capital which had employed that value before, wait a long time, before he can employ any new value, either real or imaginary, into the same capital; a period of many years indeed, it may be, but a period, which is certainly not very distant from the beginning. The same thing may, in a still greater variety of circumstances, be true of other parts of capital; of stock reserved in reserve in the warehouse of a great merchant for immediate consumption, or for immediate sale, and of the lands and capital employed about those two different objects. The owner of the lands which had been cultivated and improved by the stock reserved for immediate sale must, immediately after that stock has ceased, continue to wait a long time before he may employ any more stock in cultivation.

In the rude state of things in which the society is placed, such capitals may frequently be employed with advantage. The farmer has a better chance for purchasing, with his surplus produce, whatever else is necessary for his own use, and which he has occasion for; than any artificers and manufacturers have for purchasing with what remains of their own productions. The manufacturer has no occasion for a great stock of materials; but he has occasion for some quantity of the materials and finished work of artificers, and of some stock of merchants and journeymen of both kinds

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 283

. But though the demand for all these things is necessarily limited, it may be extended beyond what the nature and situation of the employment will allow; as, in the case either of a merchant, or a journeyman tailor, for example. A particular place of business is not necessarily necessary, or sufficient, for supplying the demand for any of them; because the employment itself, if properly directed, may be able, without any particular store or warehouse of any sort, to supply that demand, without ever having occasion to employ a single additional person of any other kind, or even of a different species of creature. The employment of an artificer is not necessarily limited either by its being in some distant place, of no considerable size or bulk; or by the poverty, wretchedness, and oppression of the neighbourhood; because the neighbourhood, too (for the poor can always find some way or other of finding employment), may be tolerably well supplied.
The same thing may, perhaps, be said of the different branches either of foreign, as well as domestic manufactures. Foreign trade is, in most cases (except, perhaps in the rude beginnings of manufactures, such as the making of glass, iron, &amps;c. which require a very extensive market, as well as great expense and ingenuity), naturally conducted upon the same principles as domestic trade. A foreign merchant is likely to employ as great a quantity of industry, as he can in order to supply a distant market, of which the supply is continually increasing; and the same thing may be said of a country which has not yet acquired this degree of wealth. The manufactures, therefore, which are carried on by means of a foreign capital, are, like those of domestic trade; naturally extended over a greater surface of land than the rude produce of their own country; and like them, the whole capital of the country which lends them the money, or employs them in manufacturing them. The capital which lends the foreign capital, is the same with that which employs the foreign merchant; but it may sometimes happen that, while he continues in the country which employs him, the country itself does not acquire the same degree or variety of wealth which would enable him to employ the same quantity or variety of industrials with the same ease and profit. In this event, it will generally, indeed, be necessary that the country in whose interest it has been employed, should continue in the same condition for which it had been employed before. But the capital, which

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 284

employs the productive labourers, is never completely consumed by them; but, in order to maintain and supply their masters, is continually returning into his stock reserved for immediate consumption, and which is, therefore, never quite exhausted.

It is otherwise with mines of which the returns are very distant; and in such mines it becomes of much more consequence that the returns be as quick as possible. The capital which mines such mines, is always completely consumed, either by the productive labourer or the owner of that labour, before it returns either into its original stock reserved to be immediately employed, or into that reserve which must always remain in the same proportion, though it may vary from place toplace. The produce, therefore, which can thus be annually brought to bear upon the annual revenue of the country which produces such mines, can be of very little value. It may be worth while, therefore, to employ the capital in such mines; provided the returns, too, are as quick as can be, or as may be expected.

If, in any particular place, a capital of any kind, of which the annual consumption had been fully consumed before it could return either into its original stock reserved for immediate consumption, or even into that reserve which must always remain in that same proportion, should happen, by accident, to be brought into a state in which its returns could not be so quick, the whole value of that capital might be lost. The capital would soon return to that state; and, if there was no other means of supplying the demand for the annual produce, the whole annual revenue would be consumed, either immediately or soon after it was produced, and the country would sink into the same condition in which that capital had been brought into. The only means by by which the country might recover from this situation, is by employing the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, not in maintaining a capital for which its annual consumption had already fully been consumed before it could come back either to its original or to its reserve stock. In order to carry this view of things beyond this very simple illustration, we shall suppose, for the sake of argument, that a particular person has, in a particular town, the capital of L., the amount, perhaps, which may sometimes happen to be necessary to enable him to purchase, with a moderate profit, all that part of his neighbour's land which is fit for raising corn, and in which that species of produce can be brought into

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 285

competition with it; or, in plain English (and I use the language with which the vulgar writers on agriculture understand it) he has the whole value or rent of that part of it. He endeavoureth then to cultivate that part of it himself, by means either of a stock reserved for that purpose in a warehouse in the town (for, though he may be able, with a moderate capital, both in cultivation and in store, yet, as the profits are much smaller, so must be the stock), or of a particular sort of stock which he keeps in his own possession. The rent of this sort, or the interest upon the money borrowed upon it, being greater or smaller, depending upon the different abilities of the farmer, must necessarily determine the quantity and value of corn he can bring into competition, or, in other words, must determine what rent he can expect upon his corn lands. If, by keeping the stock reserved for the farm in his own power, and not employing it in the manner in whose favour it is supposed to reside, the owner could raise, with the same profits, a greater quantity of this particular species of corn than if employed in a more usual and profitable manner, he would, in both cases (and, in reality, the former must be the case, as the latter must be the latter), get the rent which he would have got, if he had employed the whole of it. In this case the owner, too, would gain the advantage, either by a greater quantity being sold at a better price, or by a greater number being bought up. But, if, by keeping this stock reserved for the farm in the hands of a steward, the owner could neither raise nor buy up any corn, but could, in consequence of a particular crop, enjoy a rent, which was precisely in proportion to his own consumption, he would be able both to sell the surplus, and to buy the corn at a cheaper price than any corn farmer who employed his whole stock in cultivation, and, consequently, to make both a larger profit and a smaller rent, and to share, as well with other farmers, the whole produce of the corn land, as with the steward; and the whole quantity of this species, or the value of this rent, being exactly equal to that of all the other corn land of the country, the whole produce of it, in the one way, or the same way, could, in the same proportion, be

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 286

distributed among all its inhabitants, and the whole value of all its inhabitants' labour could likewise, as nearly as possible, be distributed to them. In the corn lands of Holland, the rent of the landlord is generally supposed to amount to between ten and twelve millions a-year. This is a very large rent, but it is no more than sufficient for the support of a very expensive agriculture, in proportion to the produce which it affording. The whole produce, however great, is distributed among the inhabitants of Holland, and not to the owner of the stock which cultivated those lands, who has no such advantage.

The rent of land in a particular country, it has already been shown, may be considered as the price paid for the exclusive privilege of cultivating certain portions of it. But this price is paid not for the land itself, but for what may happen afterwards to the rent. If it should ever fall into the hands either, 1. of a private person; or 2. to the proprietor of some public lands; it would not be for the better, but, on the whole (which is not always, perhaps, to be depended on), the worse.

A tax upon the rent, which was so far all in the hands of private persons, might, no doubt, occasion some rise in its price, though it would probably do so much more gradually than it could in the case where it fell entirely into the hands of government. The proprietor would be glad of the new tax, which he would think he owed, as well for the support of his old system as for the maintenance of his present estate, the whole produce, which, in proportion to its consumption, he might then have the liberty to keep, or to sell, at any time within a reasonable rent, without being liable either to be burdened by the new taxes or to have his lands taxed at a higher rate than any other lands of the country.


 PART III.


 Of Taxes upon Stock.

The profits of trade, it is said by the learned Doctor Davenant,[50] are everywhere regulated, in most cases by some fixed rule or maxim, the maxim, that the risk ought to be as much as possible taken, and, consequently, that the reward should be as much as can well afford. But if, in a country, where the common people have little or no capital stock, this rule seems not to be perfectly applicable; if it

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 287

does not always lead to the most advantageous method of supplying them from foreign markets, the same quantity of home produced, with a much better price than what would otherwise be paid in foreign, it will at least lead to the most advantageous.

It is the same case with bounties. If the bounties upon the exportation of any particular sorts of fish were not proportioned to the price which the merchant might expect for their sale in foreign countries, but only according to the supposed value of those foreign countries, it seems not impossible that, in such cases, the quantity exported could not be fully sufficient for supplying the home demand; that, in a country where, in consequence either either either of the natural fertility of its fisheries, or of the bounty, the whole produce of the fishery was overstocked, the bounty could not raise it so high as it otherwise might have been in such a situation; or that, even though the whole produce was not overstocked, the whole quantity exported would not always be sufficient, even in this state, for supplying that home demand. The same quantity exported might, perhaps in such a situation, afford a very large bounty; and, in this case too, it might not be necessary that the merchant himself, who, by the natural superiority of the demand, would be obliged, for the sake of a small gain, to sell his goods somewhat dearer than he otherwise might do.

The same bounty which raises the ordinary rate of profit, and thereby enables the farmer to pay a greater rent to his landlord, raises the same bounty, and thereby enables the manufacturer to pay a still greater price to his employer, and consequently a still higher profit. But though both the farmer and the manufacturer are enabled, by this increase of profit, to pay a greater price to the consumer; the one, however, in proportion, not so much to the diminution of the quantity, but to that of the value, of what they sell; and the latter in proportion not only not to the diminution of the quantity, not to that of what they buy, but to that of what it costs them to buy it; yet the former is enabled, in the completest manner, to afford the greatest possible bounty, and the last is enabled, in the least complete way possible, to afford the least.

The same quantity of home produced goods, therefore (by means either of bounties or bounties upon exports), may afford bount

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 288

s or bounties upon the exportation of a greater quantity of foreign commodities.

Bounties are given upon the exportation either of home-made, as well as upon that of foreign commodities. The home-made commodity is always of less value than the foreign one. It affording a bounties, it must, therefore, likewise affording a bounty. But the foreign commodity, if it affords no bounty, is of no value to the country, which has nothing to exchange for it, except, perhaps, the labour of the person who makes it; which, in many cases, is very little. A bounty upon the ex-portation, however, is always of more value to that country than any foreign one, and may, in many cases be more advantageous. It affords a bounty to that particular nation only which is to receive the returns of the exportation, or to whom that particular commodity belongs, or which is likely afterwards, by the increase of its own industry, to purchase it with some part of the produce of that other which was sent out. It gives the bounty, and the commodity itself gives the encouragement; and though it should not return, it does not go out of the country; because, if it did, no new bounty would be given. It is the most effectual preventive of the exportation of a superfluous, but of no value commodity, such, for instance, as a superfluity of labour, or of provisions. A bounty upon the ex-exportation, too, is more likely than any foreign bounty to increase the quantity of home produced commodities, by opening a greater market to them.


A bounties upon the exportation, not only occasioned by a particular duty upon the importation, of a foreign commodity of some kind, such as salt, but sometimes occasioned by a particular tax upon its export, are, in this manner both more advantageous and less advantageous than a direct duty upon import. The former is always of greater advantage, because it affords a bounty to that particular country, and the latter always of greater advantage, because it affords an additional encouragement, which, if it was taken away, might very likely occasion a much greater exportation. But a duty upon the ex-exportation of any foreign commodity, such as a tax upon salt, is always more disadvantageous, not only to the country which pays it (the merchant or manufacturer), and not only to that particular country

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 289

, but to every country which receives it, than the prohibition or restraint upon its ex-exportation, or even upon the carrying trade, would be; because it necessarily occasions an exportation, of which some part is always overstayed in the country from which it is imposed. It necessarily occasions an importation of foreign commodities from a foreign market which is not meant to supply the home market. The ex-exportation of a foreign commodity, by restraining the home production, and thereby preventing a more abundant supply from coming into competition, is necessarily the same as the prohibition of its re-exportation, which is always more disadvantageous.

A nation, therefore, of hunters, for example, which has no foreign commodities, can always purchase them of its own surplus produce, of which, however, it is generally more scanty than the demand of the neighbouring countries. The prohibition of exportation hinders it from purchasing of this surplus produce the foreign goods of the neighbouring nations with the surplus produce itself, of the cattle, and other provisions of the land, which would otherwise have been consumed there. It necessarily occasions an importation of foreign goods of the same kind from a distant country. The carrying trade, by supplying a still further distant market with a greater quantity of the same kind of foreign goods than what the home consumption could easily absorb or consume themselves, must always, by some means or other, contribute towards the ex-portation, either, first, of some part of those foreign commodities themselves; or, secondly, of some goods of the like kind which are produced at home. The carrying trades are always more favourable to the carrying than to the exportation of foreign commodities, and consequently to the carrying than to that exportation. They are, besides, more favourable both to the carrying of some foreign commodity, and to the carrying of the commodities themselves which are carried by the carrying trade, than to that carrying which consists in the carrying of those commodities to a distant country; because, by facilitating both, they enable the merchant to carry a great quantity of the goods of the neighbourhood more easily than he otherwise could do; while, at the same moment, they obstruct the free circulation of a great part of them to a distant market, from which they cannot easily be drawn back again.

The carrying trades, accordingly (by enabling the inhabitants of one part 





The bearing, or the trade which consists in carrying foreign, or rather,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 290

the goods carried from one country to another, are, perhaps, by far the most important of all trades; because it is upon this that every other depends for its subsistence. It is upon this that the greater parts either of the inhabitants or of the merchants who carry foreign goods from one country to another derive their whole or almost their whole subsistence. It was thus, by the progress of manufactures and foreign trade, that the carrying trades gradually extended themselves through the greater parts of the country; first through the greater part of those parts which lay nearest the sea-coast, and afterwards, in due course, through the greater parts both 

¾

The carrying trade is a branch of foreign commerce which is altogether independent of, and independent of, the agriculture of any country, of which commerce, as such, it may be considered merely as the means by by which the inhabitants of one country purchase foreign commodities, and carry them home again.

In the ancient state of Europe there was no division in the greater part of trades which consisted of two parts, of which the one was carried on by merchants and adventurers, and the latter by artificers and manufacturers. Those trades which consisted altogether of the one were called by that name. They were, however (by the present writers), sometimes called the merchant trades. In those ancient times, the greater parts either of the inhabitants or of the merchants who carried foreign commodities from one country to other derived, not their subsistence, but their subsistence from some sort of revenue arising from land, from cattle, from mines, and, in general from whatever might afford some sort of rent or profit. The wages of the labouring poor were scarce any thing; so that they could not well live by the sale of their own produce, or, what came to the same thing, by the sale of the produce of other people. The price which the dealers at the different markets charged upon such commodities as they sold by retail, was, in those ancient days, the only price at which they could have any reasonable expectation of being able either to pay their own wages, or to sell the greater portion either immediately or in the course o f their employment, with something more to give for it. Such commodities, therefore, could not commonly afford any rent to their dealers.

The extension of the carrying trade in consequence of the invention of money, by facilitating the transportation of goods from place to place by land, has rendered this sort of foreign commerce,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 291

in general and in particular, a very great source both both both both of revenue and of power to all great commercial nations. It has enabled those who have acquired it to carry on their trade, not only without any exclusive privileges, but, upon equal or nearly equally fair conditions with any other merchants; because they can exchange their surplus produce for gold and silver pieces, at a much cheaper price than they could have had it exchanged in their own native commodities. It has likewise enabled those who have no such exclusive privilege either to export or to purchase foreign commodities of the same kind with what they export or to purchase those of their neighbours; because, in consequence either of the cheapness or the convenientness of the money-market to all such foreign commodities as they have, or of some other cause, their value is generally sufficient to purchase or command such a premium as enables those who possess it to purchase foreign commodities with them. The carrying trades, therefore, not only give great encouragement and support both directly and indirectly, both directly to the industry and to the revenue, but contribute, in general and in particular, to the great prosperity and extension of the commercial world.

In consequence of this extension and improvement of foreign commerce by means of money, the art and science of war, which in the beginning of the world consisted in the knowledge and application of those arts and science, has gradually extended its range, both to distant countries and to distant periods of time, as the art of navigation, that is to say, the art which consists in knowing how and in what manner, both to move from place toplace, as well as to fortify against the enemy, has become a part both of foreign and domestic commerce. The knowledge which is requisite for the performance either either of those two different sorts of military service, or even for that of any other military duty, has gradually extended its range, too; not only to distant countries and to remote periods, but to the present, to the last century, at least, at the rate at least of one or two hundred years; at least if one may judge from experience, the slow, steady progress which the science of war has been gradually making towards that perfect science, and towards that perfection of military skill and dexterity, which, according to modern ideas, ought to belong only to the ancients. In the progress, too (I say nothing of that rapid), we may observe the following remarkable fact. Though in ancient times, both by land

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 292

and by water (for the sea-carriage of fire-ships is now so very easy), it was more convenient for the merchant-adventurer, or even the private soldier, who had nothing but his musket, to carry fire on his person than to sail upon his boat, or to wade along the shore in the surf, he was, from the nature of things, more or less obliged to employ some sort of fire-carriage; and the sailors and coast-guards of every country are always, upon such occasions, under the command of the officers who stand most in awe and veneration of the great lords. In those days, therefore, when the ordinary course of things required a greater degree both of courage and skill than at present in time, the sailors, who were, in many respects (for they had then little else besides their own skill and experience to recommend them to their masters), not less ignorant and barbarous than the greater portion even now of their fellow-citizens; and who, besides, had not, perhaps, the same advantages in the art of war which they have at present in the arts of war; yet in the naval service they had a good deal of superiority, and the officers, though inferior to the sailors, yet were not altogether so ignorant. The superiority of the sailors, in proportion as the seamanship was better, was always greater, too; because it was generally more advantageous, in order that the greater part of them might be enabled, more easily and more easily to execute, some new contrivance, which the officers had thought proper for introducing into the art of war. But though in those days the sailors had a good advantage in the superiority of their skill and experience; the officers, though they had a good deal of it too, had none at all, except in the superior knowledge and skill with which they could execute the contrived expedients of the officers.

But in modern times, the superiority in the skill of seamanship seems to be much less, than it used to have once appeared to those officers. In a modern navy, where the sailors are generally maintained by their own companies and companies of mariner, the officers have no other means of subsistence than by the wages of their own labour; the sailors, who, in most cases, have no wages at hand, but are maintained altogether by the profit which they can make upon the stock which they employ, and who, consequently, have no

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 293

other source of revenue but the wages of their labour.

The same cause which, by different degrees of luxury and extravagancy, renders some nations of merchants, such as those of Genoese or Tartar manufacture in Asia and America, much richer than others; causes, besides, a considerable proportion, too of all these wealthy merchants, both to the merchants themselves and their countrymen in general, to acquire great fortunes; and this is not the least agreeable circumstance in the world to those who love liberty. It is the cause of that liberty. The freer the traders, and the freer their country, the more they enjoy that freedom. It is the cause which renders them happy and contented, which gives their industry and industry the most vigorous encouragement, and which enables their countries to enjoy that prosperity, and to enjoy that happiness, which their wealth and industry can bestow.

It is not the militia only, however; but it must always be inferior, in every respect, both in numbers and strength, to a standing army. In time of foreign war it must likewise be inferior, though, in modern wars, the armies of the mother countries seldom amount to half a million of men. But the militia of any country, even that of an agrarian state such as Switzerland, must always be much inferior, not only to a standing army of the same size, strength, and discipline, but to one of a very different kind, consisting altogether of a militia of soldiers, maintained at the expense of the state; because, in a well regulated standing army, the whole people are kept at a distance from the frontiers, and are employed only in repelling attacks from the rear, and in repulsing sudden attempts upon the frontiers. The militia, however well managed, is never so well exercised, nor so well commanded, as the standing armies of a modern European nation. In time of war, when it has once been determined upon, and it has become necessary for a great body of men to be collected together in order to fight a great battle, they are maintained at all times in perfect subordination, and are under the command of their respective regiments. The soldiers, however, who have once served in a well disciplined and well exercised militia, have scarce ever been capable either of defending themselves against the enemy's arms, or of rendering any considerable resistance to the violence, or even to the tyranny of the officer whose command they were under. In

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 294

the second place, it must be remembered, the expense of maintaining a great body, of which every man is a soldier and every other man a warrior and a warrior-at-war, cannot easily be defray'd from the taxes which are commonly levied for the support of civil government. It requires a revenue sufficient to pay the wages of an equal number of soldiers; and the soldiers must be maintained in a way that enables them, with the same number, to maintain a greater body. The soldiers must have lodgages and quarters of their own. Their food, too (which, in a civilized state of society, is always of more importance than the conveniency of their quarters) must, in the first instance, be of the most wholesome and agreeable kind. In the second, it requires that it should consist in the produce either of their own lands, of their own industry, or of some sort of their own produce, of the corn which grows upon their lands, of the cattle, and even of their own poultry, provided it be rearing its young, not by the assistance, but by the labour of themselves and their servants, in such a manner as to render it of as little waste and destruction, as possible. The expense of the maintenance, too, even though it should not, in this case, arise from a revenue arising directly or indirect from the produce of their land and industry, yet it still necessarily requires that it shall consist in something which, if wasted and destroyed, would not only diminish the produce, but destroy the very foundations of the civil state, which it is intended to support; in the produce of the land and industry of their country; and, consequently of the real riches, and revenue of its people, the greatest of which are, the land and industry, the two great foundations upon which the wealth, authority, and security of all the others are built. The sovereign, who is, as he were, both the producer of the land and of the industry upon it, must be, as well as the other great officers of state, careful that nothing should remain, after defraying the whole expense of maintaining, not merely this equal, but an equal, number, and that this expense should consist, not only in a moderate rent, or in what is commonly called profit, but in a real, and not a nominal, value. The rent, or the price of a landed estate, may be supposed equal in proportion to the extent

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 295

of its cultivated land; but it must necessarily be much less in that of a manufacturing one. In a manufacturing country the whole produce is annually divided between a great number of independent workmen, who have no landlord, and who, therefore have nothing to share in the profits of any particular person, who, for his own advantage, would endeavour, by a monopolization of trade, either to raise the price, by raising their profits too high, or by reducing the quantity, either by restraining the competition, or by imposing extraordinary duties.
The rent and profit of a manufacturing land are in proportion to its annual produce. In a landed country, therefore the whole rent and profit must, upon most occasions, be greater or less, than in the most fertile and most extensive country which can be brought into competition with it; because there the whole produce must be annually distributed among a much smaller number. In every particular manufacture the capital of all the workpeople is employed, in proportion to their number; but in every other respect the land is left to its own produce. The landlord is obliged to pay to all his neighbours the rent which he thinks sufficient to compensate the stock which is thus employed in maintaining all those whom he thinks fit to employ. He has no interest to know what is really the amount of that stock, or what it really costs him. He knows, however (for he must know, or he could not afford to rent his lands properly), that it is more than enough to compensate all those who are fit for employment; and he has no interest to learn how many there are who are unfit. The whole quantity annually produced, he judges, is more than sufficient to supply all his wants, and, without inquiring how many are actually wanting, or what it really costs him, he contentedly accepts, with a contented tranquillity, whatever may be the proportion, whether great or small of that part of his produce, which resolves itself into rent or profits.

In a country where the whole annual produce is annually distributed among so great an number, a considerable part of that produce must be reserved for maintaining the labour of a few proprietors; the greater part of it for paying their own wages and the profits of their own stock; a part, however (which is always very much inferior in proportion) for paying that part of the tax, and a part for compensating the other losses which must attend such monopolization. In a landed country the whole produce, therefore

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 296

, must be employed in maintaining productive labour. If any part of it was to be spent in maintaining unproductive hands, it would soon reduce the value, not only of the whole, but of that part which could be most profitably applied to productive purposes.

In the progress, not only from the rudest, but even from the most rude beginnings, to the most refined manufactures, the same principles operate with great force; and as they have been so universally adopted in all countries which have gone through the greater portion of their improvement and cultivation, so they may, perhaps with reason be said to operate equally so with them in the less civilized countries of Europe, of Asia, or America. The greater part of manufactures which we read in ancient history were originally carried on in such countries as were still partly uncultured and in the condition of a hunting country; as, for example, in those inhabited by the Aryan, as well as in those inhabited by some other northern tribes of Indians, of whom the name, Cappadocius, is said to have given its origin. In the progress from rudest to more refined manufactures the same principles operate in the same manner, though they are not always the same expedients employed. The wool of the northern tribes, the fleece, and the skins, of animals, were the materials of many manufactures, which at first were made use of in a rude state. The wool of those northern nations is said sometimes even at present to make an article of commerce in the metropolis of London. But if it was necessary to carry on any manufactures in a rude state, the whole annual produce would probably have been sufficient for maintaining the labourers, and for procreating the stock necessary for carrying on the manufacture. In every improved state, the produce of a much greater quantity of industry, therefore (though it may sometimes exceed that of a still more advanced state, as we shall see hereafter), will generally maintain the same number, if not more, than that necessary for procuring it; and the stock which is employed about the employment of this produce will frequently be much less. The manufactures, accordingly, which at present subsist almost everywhere in Great Britain in some degree of refinement, are almost entirely made with materials of the European, and not with the Indian produce.

The arts of war are the great engines of government. They are the only means, besides the sword and the bow and arrows, for subduing a people,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 297

which can either be employed or maintained by the private donations or voluntary subscriptions of a particular class of citizens, who are not themselves maintained at the public expense. They may be considered as the great engines by which the great body of the people, or, what is nearly equivalent, the whole nation is maintained and employed.

The different orders and classes of citizens are distinguished by different ages, by different fortunes and station in life; but all the same qualifications, both personal and social, they share in common, as we shall see hereafter. In the state, however (for there can never, perhaps, be any such state in reality, though the idea may appear absurd) the distinction is not so plain.

In the state of Nature, every man, without intending it, endeavoured, as far as he was able and could, to provide himself with every necessary for the enjoyment and support of his own person. But in that state, every man, without intending it, was obliged, as it were by the natural course of things to contribute, either in some sort or another, to the support, both of the sovereign or of the state. In consequence of that necessity, the sovereign was obliged likewise, to supply the place of his subjects, who were necessarily obliged to support him. The maintenance, both of his subjects, who supported him by their labour, and, consequently, his own person, necessarily depended upon that of the other servants of the society. Those other servants had, besides, the management and command of a great part of his revenue; and the maintenance, not of their own persons only but that of the great body of his subjects, was necessarily, too, regulated by the maintenance of the same sort of persons, and by the same principles of justice, equity and humanity, by the same laws of the state, by those very same principles which regulate and determine that maintenance of their own persons. In the state of Nature there was no civil magistrate, nor was there even such a thing as a police force; and the administration of justice, in its origin, consisted in a council of twelve persons chosen annually from among the greater number, and supposed to be of more sober, more experienced and respectable stock than the great body of the people, whose conduct and character it must necessarily depend upon how far they should be able to support that administration, and how much it might require of them, and which council they would choose, or how far it should consist, at least

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 298

in a choice of two. In the civilized states, the administration, both of justice and of the common law, was entrusted to some appointed and permanent magistrate, whose character and abilities must have rendered it very difficult, if not impossible for him ever afterwards to discharge the duty with which he had originally charged himself. The councils of the twelve tables, however (the ancient Saxons called them) were all elected by a general assembly; the great lords being excluded, and a small body chosen by the burghers of the city, which, as the city was then a very great burgher-corporation, must, upon that account, necessarily have been of more 


The first act which established this subordination of ranks in the Roman empire, and in which the emperors, in order to secure their authority over their own subjects, assumed the right of electing all the inferior magistrates of the cities, seems to have consisted in an edict, made about Agrarian law, which gave the right of electing all the magistrates, both of towns and country, in each province, to the people, without regard either to their rank or to their wealth. This act seems to be connected with some of the causes which gave occasion to that institution of the senate and people, the privileges and prerogatives which they at that time granted to their respective members. It seems likewise to have consisted, in a certain measure, in the jealousy which those great princes felt towards the great lords of the city; because the former, they imagined, were always plotting and scheming to gain advantage by the means of their situation, and were always more jealous than the empress was of the latter.
The right of election, it may perhaps appear from this account of the first institution, is not very properly described in the constitution of ancient Rome; and it is only in a very loose and imperfect form, which the Romans seem to have had, even in times of the most absolute monarchy, and even in the times when that government seems to have been in a great degree established. The republic of ancient Greece had no such establishment; and the people, as they had no permanent or appointed magistracy, had no means of exercising the right which was thus usurped from them. They could, however, elect a certain number, perhaps twenty, or perhaps thirty of the principal citizens to be judges in their own courts; and they had, in this manner, the right, though but of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 299

speaking, not of making laws themselves, nor of making war, but only of making peace, or of concluding peace treaties with their neighbours. The sovereign, however (who, as long ago as the times of the Romans, had generally no other function but to attend upon the elections of those judges), might, if he thought it necessary, interpose, in some cases, and in all, either by withdrawing his consent from such treaties, or, by declaring them void, or, by taking some particular action in respect to them; but always with the express or implied permission of such judges, whom he was always bound, upon such occasions, to respect as equals.

The sovereign, as long as he respected those judges who had been chosen according 

 


L.3 

The sovereignty, as it has gradually extended itself through all the different parts of Europe, and as it seems, too, gradually to have extended itself still further, has everywhere been exercised by a multitude, which is always more numerous, better paid, and better armed, than even those judges who had been chosen in the election; because it is always cheaper to buy their votes, and consequently to bribe their confidence, and, consequently, their authority. The judges, too, who were originally elected by those citizens, though, from motives either good, bad or indifferent, and from no very essential circumstance, necessarily tended to render the administration of their judicial office more corrupt than it otherwise might be. They had no other security than the reputation which the greater part of their fellow-citizens would naturally have bestowed upon their character; and their private interest, joined to the public interest, was necessarily the only security that the judges had against the misconduct or malversation of any one man of the whole body of the people.

But the administration, as it gradually drew to itself more power and more authority, the judges gradually ceased to have any other protection against that corruption which naturally arises from a multitude of independent contributors; and the whole administration, as it gradually grew up to be more extensive and more expensive, necessarily became more and better managed; till at last, as it became necessary to support, not only the dignity and independance, but the revenue and expense, even, of that immense empire, the judges were reduced altogether out-of-doors, and became mere trustees for the people; entrusted both with making peace with their neighbour, and making peace with their principal sovereign, and charged

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 300

, too, with maintaining that empire. In the progress of the administration of justice, therefore, the fees which were given to the judges gradually became greater and more numerous, till, in a great country like France, where a hundred judges are frequently employed, the whole annual produce might be reckoned a million sterling; a million sterling which could no more be spared for maintaining those very judges who were meant to maintain that dignity and independency, and with whom it was meant the peace of France might be concluded.
The administration of justice, therefore, though, from the nature of things, it must necessarily have been more expensive than the judicial system itself; yet, in the end of the fifteenth, sixpence a-day being the ordinary rate at which the judges received their salaries from the king, and the whole annual produce of their salaries, the whole administration must, it seems to have been supposed by all the writers who have collected this money price of justice, have cost more than two millions a year; a million more than the whole expense of maintaining that judicial system itself. But, in reality, the administration of justice was, in the beginning of the reign of Charles II., not only not very expensive, nor, perhaps (I am afraid I may say so), very much above the common rate of the times, but, upon the whole, probably much less expensive than the judicial system itself. It was, indeed (I have already observed), during the minority of that prince, and during the minority both of his brother-in-law the Duke of Orleans and his mother, the duke of Orleans particularly; and, in order that the administration of the courts of justice in France might be as independent and as effectually supported as that which is exercised over the lower courts in England, it became necessary, during that minority, to give some additional encouragement, both in the salary and in the appointment of certain judges; and, upon that account, a very expensive system of judicial government, which was not likely, in the smallest measure to improve the state, or to promote the happiness, either of that state or of that family, was established.

But the whole expense of the administration, of which this million is composed, was not, in those times, laid out in the support of the judicial system. The salaries of the justices of peace and the officers of the king's household, the expenses which were laid aside in pursuances of the old system, and which,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 301

by this new arrangement, were brought into a direct proportion to their salaries; and all the other ordinary charges and revenues of the sovereign's court and household, which were laid aside in pursuances too of the old system. The expense, therefore, of those expenses, amounted, it seems, to L1,948,000 sterling. The whole expense, therefore (according to the new system), must have been at least double that sum. But if the whole expense, therefore, which, according to the old, was laid out in maintaining, first the court and household of the sovereign, and afterwards the several courts of justice, and the different branches of the administration of justice, was at any time, during the course of these four years (1765), not only equal, but greater, than it was during that period, there can be little or no doubt that, during the continuance of those four, the whole annual expense of government must have been, not less, but greater than at present. In 1765, accordingly, we find that the annual revenue of the crown, including both its public and its ecclesiastics funds, amounted to upwards of £2,500,000 sterling; and the annual expenses, both of the crown and its various departments and establishments, to upwards of £531,-,600 sterling.

In the year 1767, however, the expense of the court of justice, including not merely what is necessary for maintaining the officers of the court, and the clerks and sub-councilors of the judges, and the other officers who attend upon their proceedings; but what is also necessary for paying the clerks and agents of the various attorneys and counsellors employed about the administration of justice, and the clerks of those different attorneys and counsellors, together, amounting to about three millions a-year; a very considerable increase of expense from the one year to another, is observed in that branch, from which, in former times, so little had ever yet been drawn. In the same year, however, it is computed by some people, that the revenue of the court was only £2,895,000; whereas the whole annual expense of that branch, including not only the ordinary expense, of maintaining all the officers, but all the extraordinary, as well as that of the judges, must, they imagine, have amounted, at least, to more than five millions. This increase of expense must necessarily, in a

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 302

great measure, have been laid aside when this debt had become due, and it was necessary that some part either, first of all, or, secondarily of this debt, was paid.

In Great England, the sovereign is, upon most occasions, obliged to borrow upon his own credit. His revenue, which he derives, not only directly, from this revenue, but from the rents and profits of his own land, is a fund for which, though it is subject, too, to occasional fluctuations, yet it is, perhaps, in most countries, the most solid and permanent of all funds. The expense of his government, therefore, must always bear some proportion, either to this revenue, to that part of it, or both to these two parts; to that part, in order to maintain the public works and institutions for which that revenue was originally raised. In the progress, therefore, of the late war, the public debt, as it increased gradually from year  To year  - so it must necessarily have increased, too, in proportion to the increasing expense, and must have been at its greatest, not so very distant, not so much from the end of the last war, but at that beginning.
The expense of the late war amounted only  To year o

 The whole expense of the late wars, including not merely the ordinary annual expenses, but what may be called extraordinary exigencies and emergencies of state, was, during the continuance of those wars (the first of them in 1756, and the second of them, by the treaty of Utrecht, in 1803), and till after they had been brought to an end by the treaty of Ghent, and till the 5 th of December 1775 (the day on which the peace between Great Britain and France, which began the 7 th November 1772), the whole revenue which the different contributors to the support of those different governments derived from their respective subjects.
The war in 1755 cost the inhabitants, both of Great Britain and Holland, more than £1.543,000,000, exclusive of the interest of the money borrowed upon it. It cost Great Britain, besides this, more than L.2,400,00,00 in the loss and destruction, both of her merchant vessels and of her colonies in America. It cost Holland more than L.1,200,000 in the loss and destruction of its shipping. The whole war cost, therefore,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 303

in the year of the conquest, not less, it is computed by Montesqulian,[30] than the whole expense of that campaign, including the four sieging of Acre; not more than double of the annual expense of the late war in Flandres; and, at the end of that long war (which ended in the reduction of Portugal to its present nominal sum of only eight millions, the fourth part of which has never been drawn back), more, perhaps, than the whole annual expense of that long war. The greater the expense, the greater must likewise have been the profit, and the less must necessarily be the interest of that capital, which was thus employed in maintaining productive labour, and in producing a revenue equal to the maintenance, both civil and martial, of a hundred thousand men.

It is not necessary, indeed, that the tolls upon caravans of caravans should be paid before they set sail; for the same reason that it is not necessary that they should be drawn back after they have sailed. But the whole expense, either of building or repairing roads or canals or harbours, ought certainly to be charged upon the first loading and unloading, before the goods can set out upon their way.

Tolls for passage upon carriages drawn by beasts, &amp.;amp;c. are very much in fashion, not only at present, but in the times preceding the discovery of the American mines, and even before the first European settlement in America, as well in the northern as in that in some parts of the south of France, where they are commonly called carrousels or cart-carriage. In Holland, they call them helepolisers, from their resemblance to a horse-car. They have, however (for the same cause), been prohibited in England; and in Scotland and Wales they are still called cart-carriage, though in the name of a coach. In the reigns of Charles II. and II.III., the king gave directions, that carriages of any kind, either of load or wheel, not be allowed to pass over his highways without first being examined by his officers; that they should be obliged to give security to the persons whom they left in charge, that they would not obstruct their passage, or hinder him from making any inquiry into what was there done. This prohibition was continued by his son and successor. The term, therefore, for the giving

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 304

security to the toll-gatherers, is very long; and, in most cases, it will extend over many successive years, or through a considerable number of successive toll-years, before it can be fully paid.

When a toll-gate has once been opened, the keeper of that particular road, who is charged, not only with the maintenance of the tolls, but with the revenue which arises from them; must always be under an irresistible temptation to raise the toll, either immediately upon the expiration, of the original period for which the toll was paid, or, if that term should happen to expire before the expiration, upon the reopening, of the toll, without any penalty. The temptation, besides this obvious disadvantage, is even more formidable in those roads where the tolls are advanced by a weekly, than in those which are levied by monthly payments, or where the tolls, though they may continue for several years together, yet do so in a much more moderate manner, and are at least equally well paid.


 ART. III.


Of the Expenses which are Necessary and Proper for the Public Purposes, and for which the Sovereign is answerably Accounted for.

The sovereign is answerable only for the revenue, expenses, and losses which he actually incurs in the execution of his duty, either as head, or as minister, or as regent, or as regent pro tempore, and not for those which he might have incurred had no one other being interested in his administration. He is accountable for the expense, therefore (though not, indeed, for that which is necessarily connected therewith), of all the inferior officers of revenue; of those who execute and collect the taxes, and those whom it is necessary to instruct in the duties of their respective stations; those of the officers who prepare, lodge, and convey taxes to the different collectors of those duties. He must likewise answer for those which he may, without injustice, consider to have arisen, not only directly from the negligence and misconduct of those who execute, collect, or prepare the duties, but from other causes which are not altogether destinate, such, perhaps as arise out of the nature of things, but of which the sovereign is never at fault, and for which he cannot be held responsible, such, for example as are occasioning extraordinary expenses. The expense of his family, his household furniture, equipage and household furniture of his servants

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 305

, &amp;c. are not less than what would have been required to maintain a single labourer, or a slave, for a whole day, week, month or year, in a civilized country. His capital, too (which is, no question about it, his revenue), must be considered as the same as his revenue. It must be sufficient to maintain and employ a quantity of productive labour, sufficient, at least, to replace, with a profit, all the stock, materials and provisions employed in its employment, together with their ordinary and reasonable profits.

The expense of a journeyman artificer is not much greater than that of a common labourer. The capital, too, which he possesses, must be the same. He can either employ a single, or a double industry. He cannot, therefore, maintain any other industry, except that of a single one. His wages are, no doubt very low. But the wages paid to journeymen, even of common labour in a rude society, are always much lower than to artificers in the advanced state of improvement, who are generally paid more than the common rate. In a rude society, therefore, the expense of such an artificers stock must be very small. It is so in China and Indostan. In China and the West Indies it is still further reduced, it is pretended, in many places by a system of taxation, which makes it necessary to keep a great many artificERS, artificers, and journeymen, unemployed, and, therefore, not only not paying, but contributing to maintain a great number of labourers and menial servants; the former, indeed, being frequently taxed in order to maintain the former, the latter sometimes taxed to support the latter. In China the expense, it is said, upon every sort of manufactured produce, is computed to be as great as three or four times that of Europe.


The expense, it may perhaps, in the progress of improvement, even upon the most improved plan of roads and navigations, be still much less, both in money and labour, than it had been before the invention or improvement of such improvements; and yet, in consequence of the improvements, both in the quantity and in the quality of the commodities which can easily pass through such a highway or navigable channel, a great deal more, perhaps, can easily be brought to pass through them. The expense of a rich man's house may be as little, or as

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 306

great as his revenue, according as the nature of his situation, his situation being always that of a private man, whose revenue is always greater or less than that of any great prince. His house is his private estate, and is subject neither, either to taxation, nor inspection by the civil authority, but, like every other part of his estate which is under the management and protection of his private persons, it is liable only, in cases where the sovereign should neglect or refuse, to be seized and destroyed, and to be subjected either to an exact inspection or a forfeiture of its use, if the state of things which would otherwise require it should require that it should not remain. It is the duty of government, therefore, to give it no particular attention.
The expense of a poor mans house, on contrary (for there are always some rich and poor), is everywhere much greater than that either of a private or of a prince. It is the peculiar property of the landlord. The rent of the house is his sole revenue; his whole revenue is spent, not upon the house itself only, or even upon what it is likely to purchase or produce, but upon that part of his land, and upon what is likely to grow up from that land, of the produce of which he can thus afford to purchase a part. The landlord, however, as he has a certain property in this produce of his land (which he is obliged, in most cases, either to cultivate or to waste), so he has likewise a property in what it yields. The rent of his land must be such as to enable the farmer to pay the rent of this house, together with its necessary expenses. The landlord is not, therefore, under any necessity of maintaining this expensive house. The farmer can afford, therefore, to maintain him without any extraordinary expense. The landlord, however, is obliged always to maintain the farmer; and the expense, besides, of the farm, and that of maintaining the landlord's cattle, is the principal expense which he incurs, either in maintaining himself or in employing a tenant, or both together, and which, in the actual state in which things are at present, he must always maintain with the utmost care and attention. If, by any accident of government, the farmer's revenue should be reduced by one half, the loss of the farm, the loss of his cattle, the diminuation of his produce, must occasion, in the actual state in which things are, a

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 307

very great dearth, or at least such a dearth as may very much affect his circumstances, and, perhaps, his life and health. But if the government had taken care to prevent this one half loss by imposing the duty, it might have prevented the whole; and if, instead, it had given him a very moderate tax upon his corn and other goods in the way that it did, he would not probably, even in that case, have been obliged, for many years together, to pay so heavy an annual rent.

In the different customs which have taken shape during the course of this century, the importer, when he brings his goods into a particular port of the kingdom for exportation, has been allowed to deduct, upon payment of an administration fee of two shilling, the value of his duty, and to bring back his goods with an additional value. If, in the course of this fee (for it was never very high) he has not got back his whole duty upon the import, and consequently his entire duty, upon his goods, the whole of it goes to the king's exchequer; and, as he has not paid his whole duty upon his import, the whole remains to him, after making good what has been lost by the administration of the tax. The duties which have been imposed for this purpose, though they are very different in different ports and in different years, seem all to be regulated according to this principle.

When a duty of fivepences upon bread is imposed in Great Britain, and the merchant who brings it threepence cheaper than he could otherwise have got it, pays his own freight and maintenance, it is a duty of five shillings, which, though it is a very small part, does not amount to a third, or to a fourth of his money price; and it is a duty which he may, in the ordinary course of business, easily pay. But when, by the like frauds with which the French merchants have lately endeavoured to defraud us of the greater part, they are enabled to bring us our foreign corn at fourpence cheaper than we ourselves can get it, they exact from us, not a fifth only of our own money price, but of that of the farmer, who, in the actual state of his affairs, must always be obliged to pay more for the same quantity of grain. They demand from him a fifth of what, in the ordinary course

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 308

of things would go to him in rent. The fourth is reserved to himself, and is called profit, and consists, according to the different modes in which it is commonly divided among proprietors, in the profits of stock, in wages, or in profit upon land; in what is commonly called the rent of land, and which in England is computed by the ancient method. The fifth is called profit, and is commonly computed, not in the ordinary way of profit, according as it falls into one of those four distinct parts above mentioned; but according as it is over-tracked in one, or over-committed to one of those four different parts. The rent of land in the neighbourhood of London is commonly reckoned a considerable part of that of all the other cities of England. In order to give the greater part of the inhabitants of the capital a share in its cultivation and improvement (a part which, in most places, is still very small), the proprietors, it has been thought proper, have sometimes demanded of their tenants, a third part of what was supposed, in the ordinary rent of a lease, to be their own profit; a third part, too of which the landlord is supposed to get a part, and a third, too of which he seldom gets any more than the rent itself. In the rents of many estates, too, the overseers and managers have, for a long time, demanded of the tenant a fifth, or, in some cases, even a sixth part of his produce; and this too, it has been pretended, in most cases, was a considerable part of the real rent of the land, or what the landlord could have got by the ordinary profits upon a lease, if those gains were allowed free to him, as in the present times. In the rent of the lands which are now cultivated by the English East-India company (for I know no other cultivated by them) I do not observe that the proprietor ever gets more than what is sufficient to maintain his servants and retainers; and this, I apprehend, is all he can get, without incommoding the other three-fourths or five-fifths, of what is due from him.

The rent, it has been said, of Turkey is a very great deal more than what can be drawn from the land; and that, too, according to a new system, which proposes to measure the rent of all estates, by the produce of the lands

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 309

upon which they are situated. The produce of the greater part, however, of all those lands in Turkey, is, it seems, not very nearly sufficient to pay this rent, or to maintain the inhabitants of those forts and garrisons, and other necessary buildings and out-buildings of the government. In the ancient government of Turkey, besides the capital city of Constantinople itself (of which the greater portion was originally the property, not only of the Turks, as at present), there were in all the different provinces of Turkey several hundred different castles, which had all, either before, or during, their continuance in the possession of the Turks, been maintained, not by any regulated rent, but according to the expense which each particular proprietor thought proper to make of his own particular possession. The rents which those castles paid, accordingly (according, perhaps to the old system, to an equitable estimation, according to the system of the present author, and to the valuation at present commonly made of such things by every man of sense in the country), varied greatly, and were not always equal, though they generally were very near to it. In some provinces, they were very nearly upon an equal footing. In others, they varied from twenty to thirty per cent., according to what the different lords thought proper to lay out upon them, according as the seasons, and, in particular, what the produce of the land was supposed to be at that particular time. The produce, it seems, in all the different parts of Turkey (which is very populous and well cultivated), is much less, perhaps, than the whole extent of the lands upon which all those different castles were situated, or than the value which the different proprietors of all these lands might think proper to lay upon them, according to what the seasons might happen, and, in particular, according to what the produce of the land might happen to happen to be at the particular time. In the greater part of the Turkish dominations, besides all the castles of Turkey, there is no town or large village which does justice to the name, or which is capable of containing a thousand people, or which has not some considerable estate or building of some kind, of which the maintenance is defrauded by the improper administration of justice, by the oppression and injustice of the clergy, and which is, in consequence, not only neglected, but in a certain degree oppressed, and in danger, it may be imagined too, of being swallowed

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 310

by its own vices and vassalages. The great estates of Turkey are, upon this account, very properly described as those of a city, or as those of towns and villages; because they have all been granted by the sovereign to some particular proprietor, who has either himself built, or bought of other men-servants, the buildings, and the lands, necessary for supporting the inhabitants.

But in countries where there is little or no revenue from the sovereign or from other public funds, such estates are, upon this principle alone, naturally divided into smaller parcels, and allotted to particular persons, who have themselves either built, or bought, the houses, the corn fields and other improvements which are requisite for supporting the cultivator, together with his wife and children. In such countries, therefore the greater the number of such proprietor, the smaller must necessarily be the whole number of his dependents; and it becomes, in the same manner, necessary to diminish the number both of his retainers, and of his servants and labours, that he himself may have room for exercising and enjoying the fruits of the labour which he has thus acquired, and that he may have leisure and inclination to employ it in other ways than that to which the nature and circumstances of the society naturally assign it. The landlord, like the proprietor, naturally feels himself more secure when he has a good deal less land to defend; because he knows that if he should have too great a possession, he will not be able either 





 To preserve, however, this possession at all times, he is careful to maintain it as exactly as possible, and is, upon this principle alone (and no other), disposed to favour his tenants, who, like his retainers and servants, have generally been hired by the proprietors.

The ancient state of Europe seems not to be much inferior to what is described in the foregoing chapter; though it is difficult, perhaps, to determine exactly in what manner the state was better governed, in what manner it had become more liberal and generous towards private property, or in what manner it had degenerated into the barbarous and oppressive government which is represented by the history and antiquity of Europe, as having taken place in many different parts of it towards the close of antiquity. The state, it has already been shown in the first book, had become more liberal, or at least more liberal and generous towards private,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 311

and less towards public, corporations; that the former, as well as all other corporations of trade and profit, had gradually acquired more freedom; while that latter, which had originally enjoyed almost total liberty, and which was originally established to facilitate commerce between the towns, had gradually degenerated into an instrument of monopoly, and had gradually given place to a more proper and propertied set of traders. In consequence of the extension of commerce, too much liberally bestowed, the greater part of these new corporations, finding it difficult or impracticable, or, on account either of their own folly, or that of their superiors, to make any considerable progress in trade, became incorporated for a particular purpose. The profits which they made by the sale, either of their own stock, of that of other people who were also incorporators, or of the stock which they borrowed of those other incorporators, were called their common profit; and the whole stock which was lent to them, either for this purpose or to another corporation for the same purpose (for they were all equally incorporated) was likewise said to belong to them in the nature of a common profit. They were all obliged to pay into the common stock of this incorporated company, for the use of this common profit, a sum equal, according to the regulations of the times, not only to the interest of the money, but to what was necessary, either for maintaining and employing the officers and agents, or for paying the salaries, of the directors and trustees, who were appointed by that company.
The directors of all these new corporations were all bound, under pain of forfeiting the whole capital, to give an annual dividend of the common stock of the company to their own particular subscribers; that of the incorporators, to one half, that of other incorporators, and to the other two thirds; and that of all others, to the whole common stock, or the interest of the whole capital of this new corporation.

This extraordinary dividend was, upon most occasions (and, upon this occasion especially, it was not very seldom so) very nearly upon the whole value of the capital employed in trade. The greater the number, and the greater, therefore the number of incorporations, the greater the number of directors and trustees; the greater, too, must necessarily be their share in the common profit, the whole of it belonging to them. But the greater part, perhaps all the great part, must necessarily have been annually drawn from some

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 312

one of those funds.

It has been said, too (I have no reason to doubt it), that the capital of a great company was originally derived from a capital of a smaller kind. The profits of a great merchant may, in this account, properly be said to arise partly from stock and partly from annuity stock. The stock is his own private property, of which the owner can dispose either always or for ever; the annuity, what is given for the use and benefit of that property, in return, not being subject either to perpetual annuities, or to the immediate taxation of government. But though the stock is his own, yet it is a common thing for a great merchant to employ, in the same manner as a farmer or tradesman employs a labourer, many other menial slaves; and it frequently costs him more labour to maintain those slaves than it would have cost him to maintain one alone. In order to make a profit, therefore (and in order to make it as great, too, as he can), he endeavours, by the most judicious application, to employ as many slaves as possible. This is a very simple and obvious maxim. It has, however (for I do not pretend that any person has ever made a profit, even upon it, by employing slaves in any sort or manner other than as necessary servants, and in no sort of work which requires a superior dexterity), not, perhaps, been the common mode of applying it, even in ancient Greece. The slaves were commonly sold as soon, as possible, after the sale, and their price paid to the master. In the times preceding the foundation of Rome, when a Roman citizen could not carry on a foreign war, but was obliged to remain at home, his whole revenue, or what he had either in land or stock, must have been derived almost altogether from stock; and his whole expense, from stock too; for it was not in those times a custom among us to pay our servants in money, except upon such very extraordinary occasions as happened sometimes to require it, and in which, by the exaction of extraordinary taxes upon the people, a very considerable revenue could be raised. The soldiers, accordingly (though not the citizens of Rome), were all soldiers, and all soldiers, it has already been observed, were originally slaves. The soldiers were maintained, too, not by money only, as in the present times, but by a certain quantity of corn;

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 313

so that the whole expense, including both wages and profit, was, upon this plan, paid from the produce of the tax, or, what comes to the same thing in this case too (for I do mean by this to include all such plans), from what remains after replacing to the different contributors, in their proper places, all the capital stock which had ever been employed about them. In this case the dividend of the company is the same thing with that of the land; for the dividend of corn is a tax upon the rent, not of land, but of money; and the dividend which is paid to the different proprietors, is in the nature both of a land and a stock dividend.

Such, therefore, was the original system of taxation, both in England, and in all other English settlements which followed it, till it was overturned, not so much by experience, as by popular clamour and faction, and in favour, not of the great, but rather, and in spite, of the great, of the landed, mercantilist, and monopolizing interests, which had always opposed it, either directly, or through the medium of their servants, in parliament. The ancient system was, that of the sovereign; and though, in modern Europe, this great authority has been usurp ed, yet the sovereign has been reduced to the same situation as in the ancient times; the same inferior being substituted into the same, or very nearly the same, situation as the great. The great interest of the great body, or of the proprietor class, is the interest, not of the sovereign only; and the great interests of the great body or proprietors are the same interests with the interests of that superior, and of the same order. They have, therefore both the same motive power, and, consequently the same ability to obstruct, or to subvert, any measure which may tend either to increase the revenue, the expense of government, the power, the or the security of the great proprietor or master class. In modern Europe, indeed, they seem to be more numerous than ever; and the great proprietors, who are the great enemies of all those measures which tend, even indirectly to their own interest, to enlarge the public revenue, to increase the authority of government, and to secure the great interests 




¼

The superiority, both in wealth and power, which has now been usurped, either directly by those who

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 314

are now called the proprietors of land, or indirectly, by those who were then the servants of the crown, seems, at least in this age of Europe, to have been very considerable. The spirit, which that great revolution introduced, was not, like the feudal tenures of the twelfth, founded altogether upon a fictitious title; it was not confined to a small territory only, but extended through the greater part of the country. In the greater portion of it, too, the old feudal rights still subsist. They have, however, in many parts of the kingdom been so completely subverted by the new laws and institutions which have taken place in it during these few years, that the ancient tenures, though not abolished altogether, yet do not exist, and the lands are commonly held in trust for a small number of people.

The spirit which this revolution introduced into Europe, though not, perhaps (I am afraid I may be guilty of this expression) original, was very much refined and enlarged during these few centuries, in a manner which had not happened before in the history of the world. The sovereigns who were its leaders, were generally men of learning, of probity, and of great industry; and the people who supported and supported them, generally shared, or were disposed, either to share or not to part, with them. But though the spirit which this revolution introduced was original, the circumstances in the different countries of Europe, which contributed to form and temper it, were not original. They were all, or almost every one of them, acquired by long residence, by great wealth, and great authority.
The French monarchy, the English parliament, the Spanish monarchy, the Austrian monarchy, and the German republics; the French and Spanish governments, and the English parliament and executive powers; the French nobility and gentry, and all that part either of Europe or of the commercial world, in which the spirit of this revolution has been carried into execution, have all been established and sustained by the acquisition of new provinces, of new territories, and new interests. All of them, therefore (except the last, which was originally founded upon the ruins of an ancient state), owe their existence to acquisitions which had been made before, and were not, perhaps (I say nothing concerning that particular government), original. But the spirit, which gave birth both to the first of these, and, I think it is now generally acknowledged by all the rest of those acquisitions

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 315

(of the Cape of Good Hope, of St. Domingo, of Benguela, &amps;c. and which, as we have seen, was the same spirit that carried the English settlements to America, and that which still animating the Spanish settlements in Chili and Peru), had not yet completely corrupted the judgment of Europe, and had not yet rendered the whole commerce between the different countries of Europe so much perverted as at present.
The East-India company were, at this period of the world, perhaps, as powerful, perhaps even, as the great trading companies of Europe. Their territorial acquisitions, too, were considerable, as well as extensive. They comprehended the greater part of the islands, or, more properly speaking of those parts of the seas, of the three seas that run into the Indian Ocean; of those of Malabars and Celebes; and of those of Caroline, Guadaloucois, and Madeira. The Portuguese colonies in India, and all the other European ones that lie north and south of the equator, except the Dutch settlements at Java, were under the immediate dominion of some of the largest of the British companies. The English, French and Dutch companies were all little more than joint-stock companies; and the Dutch were not only independent, but, as at present, not a little jealous, of their brethren at Madras, Gozo, and Amsterdam.
10. Conclusion.

In consequence of the establishment of the East India company, the commerce between India, and almost every part of Europe, was for many centuries, almost entirely carried upon a footing of perfect equality; that between the countries of Europe being, for some time after the first establishment of the company, more or less favoured by the government, in proportion, no doubt, to the value, not only of the goods which were exported from those particular places, but likewise of that which was imported into those particular countries.

But the spirit which first gave occasion to the establishment of this monopoly, was, perhaps, the same spirit that carried those great conquests into the East Indies, and afterwards carried the greater portion of Europe towards the west. That this spirit has since become altogether corrupted and effete, is sufficiently demonstrated by the course, both in Asia and America, since that period; but the ruin which has fallen upon the great trade of Europe in every part, and the total subversion of that great empire into the possession of so

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 316

many different small trading states, have not been produced by such revolutions in trade as the French have had, in the greater part of their colonies in North America.

The trade which the European states, however (for the East Indies were then considered as a part only of Europe), carried on to their East Indies colonies, was not altogether confined to a single market; but was extended through a much wider circle of foreign countries than that single one, and was, consequently regulated, not by any one exclusive company or exclusive treaty, but, as it necessarily was, in some measure by every particular caprice or prejudice, of every single European merchant or merchant-adventurer who carried on that commerce, and who was himself, therefore, in some measure subject to every particular prejudice or capricious passion of that merchant. The monopoly, too, of the Dutch, and, in particular of the venders, gave occasion, besides, both to a considerable degree, of oppression in the one case; and, in the other, to some degree of free competition. It gave occasion to some degree, not only of arbitrary and oppressive monopoly, but, on account of the great extent of the East India trade, to some degree of absolute, though frequently disguised monopoly.

Monopolists, like all men of corrupted and depraved spirits, are always ready, if you give them an opportunity of exercising their corruption, to turn that corruption into the most odiously malignant malversations, in the very person whom you have entrusted with the management of your affairs. They naturally turn it, therefore, against the people, and against the sovereign, whose authority they are afraid to have exposed to public ridicule and odium. Monopoly, besides this, is, like every other species of oppression and oppression of the weak by the strong, the natural symptom and foreshadowing of the great revolution which must soon come, either in the whole of the political institutions of society itself, or in the principal part only of those of which those institutions consist, and of which the people, the great mass of them, must be gradually corrupted and effeminated, either by the gradual improvement, in the greater or the smaller degree, in every particular part, or in the greater or the smaller number of the different branches or departments of the public revenue; in the greater or the smaller degree, or in the more rapid progress which that progress may, at any particular time, be expected, either in the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 317

whole, or, as in a gradual and successive process, in the whole, or, as it advances in the smaller, in the smaller, or in a more or fewer branches of it. The great political and commercial revolutions of all ages and nations have generally been the symptoms of this gradual degradation in the quality, in the wealth, or, as we should say, in the power, both of the sovereign or commonwealth, and of the greater part, or of the greater or less, of the inferior ranks of its inhabitants, who are continually exposed, in every part, to the violence of those great political and commercial revolutions.
The inland commerce of Great Britain has, during these twenty-five years, been almost entirely confined to one particular branch of it; the carrying trade. That branch of commerce has been so much weakened and oppressed by those obstructions in its own nature, which are inseparable from the character of the shipping, and which no human wisdom, however skilful, could easily remove, that it is at this day almost entirely incapable even of making the smallest appearance, either in a foreign or in an inland commerce of its own. It has, however, upon several different occasions, attempted to make some; and, notwithstanding all its endeavours, the carrying trades of Great England have not yet found their natural and free home in the British market; though, from a commercial point-blank view, they seem to have done so naturally, from the natural course of things, from their natural situation in the home and mother-country.
3d. In a particular branch of the inland trade, of the most extensive importation of the produce of domestic industry.

In the carrying trade, there may be successfully managed two different ways, according as the circumstances, or the situation of those two nations, happen to make either one of them more advantageous, more advantageous to foreign trade, than another; or according as it is more advantageous to the one, or to the other to employ some part of their own industry, in bringing the produce of their own industry to the foreign market; in order, in this case, either to purchase foreign goods with their surplus produce, or, what is the same thing, to sell them with something else that was purchased therefrom, in order that those foreign goods may be exchanged for some part either of our own or of the foreign commodities with which those surplus produce had been consumed. The advantages which either of these two opposite systems

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 318

has over any other, are, in every case to be found in that which is best and most advantageous for all the parties concerned; and it would be absurd, it would be downright injustice to the great body of the people, to attempt to establish one against another. The insurance trade, too, though not so much employed in war as the trade in which joint-stock companies are principally used and employed (the trade of insurers and brokers), and though it is not altogether a joint-Stock company trade (for it has its own particular laws, and is, therefore subject to some regulations peculiar to itself), yet is, like that of insurers and brokers, a joint Stock trade; is regulated by the same laws, and is, in general terms and principles of policy and management exactly, just like that trade, except that it does not pay the dividend.

It is in the insurance trade only, however, that the joint-Stock companies seem to be able, consistently with their interest as such companies, either consistently or sensationally, consistently or sensibly to combine for their own interest against the general interest of the society. The trade which pays a certain annual sum, for the maintenance of a certain number, of insured people, may, without either any combination nor injustice, be considered as an independent and separate business; the insurance of the whole country, or the public, as the common object of that trade, or the object upon which that annual payment ought, upon that account alone, properly to consist. The joint Stock company, on the contrary (which is always the case with insurance companies, though sometimes with different companies, and which is the sole institution for the insurance and protection, not merely of the insured, but, in most cases, of all the persons in a country who have property to protect, and for the purpose of which the insurance companies are established), when they have got together the whole capital, the insurance, the protection, and, consequently, the profit of the whole society, combine to support the interest of their particular company, and oppose that of all others. They are all, or nearly all of them, interested to prevent that competition which might force the price of insurance down to a level with the common price of provisions; or, in other words to raise the premium of insurance above what it otherwise might be.

In the trade which pays the whole, or the whole, of the annual maintenance, either of insured people, or of the whole society

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 319

, there are always more losers than winners. The person whose trade, therefore, pays nothing, and is thus altogether independent, enjoys the whole produce of his own industry, or, what comes to the same thing, of that labour of other people which produces this produce; and the whole society, or the whole quantity of labour which it employs, is the sole gainer. But if, on the contrary, that trade which is carried on by a part, though but a small one of the whole society, should pay some part of the annual expense or maintenance to the insurers, the gains of all the rest would be less than before. That part of the whole society, however (for there is no such thing as an independent part), would be a loser. It would not only lose a great deal more of the produce which its own industry, by employing the whole, produces annually; it might, at least in this case, suffer an additional loss of the produce which the insurance of this small portion could not compensate, because the greater part, perhaps the greater part of that portion, is continually being renewed and brought to market, and is never really exhausted.
The person who carries his trade, and who enjoys, too, the produce, not of his own labour, but that of other people's labour, has, it has already been shown, the whole produce, not of his own labour, but of the labour of other people, which is continually being brought to him, and is, in this manner, continually exhausted. His gains, therefore (and those of all the other members of the community, or of that portion which, in any country is subject to incompetent jurisdiction), must always be a loser in this particular trade, and must always bear some proportional proportion to their proportion of the total gain.
The person who is insured by an act of parliament for the benefit, not of himself, or of the whole body politic of his countrymen; and whose whole industry is, like that of the rest, continually being replaced, and brought to market; has a smaller share of this annual produce than either the first person, or even any other private citizen. His industry does, however, replace the annual expense of his society. The whole quantity of labour which it employs annually, is the sole gain of the whole body of the people, or, in other terms, of the society. But if the trade of the first, or, what comes to the same thing in the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 320

case of a master, that which consists in instructing apprentices in the art of making or wearing certain articles of clothing; in which, therefore, there is no reward, except the honourable one of being allowed a limited liberty to withdraw at pleasure from any of them, should, in any particular town, or in any given profession or occupation, be open and free to every man, the law might perhaps oblige every master, and every apprentice to give such attention, both to the instruction of his master as to his own improvement; that is, to the strict application, both of mind, body, spirit and industry, to the pursuit of that trade or profession, in which the master had so good an interest as to encourage and enable him to exert that application. The masters and their apprentices might then be obliged to attend to each particular trade, to examine into each particular art which was carried on by it; and if any of them was found guilty of negligence, misconduct or fraud in this application, he might lose his employment, and his apprenticeship be at an end.

The universities of Europe have, in many cases, not only failed in this application, and in the strict application, but they have even been very forward to establish that discipline, which it is always dangerous to trust to the accidents of human nature; a disciplining authority which is altogether arbitrary and unaccountable; an arbitrary and inexorable power, which can never fail, either to corrupt the judgment of any man, or to corrupt that judgment in such as it is directed against; an inexorable authority, which, if it is exerted with any violence or injustice, either directly, or indirectly, can never fail to degrade the character, and to corrupt the morals of all men. The masters and apprentices of each master are bound, in many universities, both to receive the lectures and to obey the orders of his superior, without which they may be fined and removed from office; and this fine, and removal, together, make up the principal fund which maintains and enables the university master to carry his business upon a fair and level. The masters and their apprentices, however (and this must be understood, not only for the benefit of the students, but for that of the masters themselves), may, in many universities at least, find a considerable security against the injustice of their superior. In those universities where there is no statute of apprenticeship (for the statute which enforces obedience to masters, in England, is of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 321

so little authority as to make any considerable change there very difficult), the master is not always bound by any bond of obligation. In those which are bound by such a bond, it may frequently be difficult for the master, without gross violation of the public trust, even for a limited time (for it seldom happens but for a limited time, and then only for a particular class of apprentices), even for a limited term, to oblige his apprentice to attend upon lectures. The Greek language was then the language commonly taught among all those who attended the universities of Europe. It had long been a favourite subject in all schools of law, physic, &amp;c. It was, besides, a very agreeable language; a very simple one, too, compared with Latin and French. The study of it, therefore (for it has never since become a very tedious or laborious one), could well be carried on by all those who had the leisure to attend upon it. It is from these circumstances that we are told of so many Greek universities being established in England, in imitation of those in ancient Greece. In the universities of Paris and Edinburgh (for the former of those two names still subsists), Latin is still the common and favourite language of instruction; but the study of philosophy has gradually fallen into disuse, in favour of the more familiar study of rhetoric and rhetoric studies; while that study, with the greater share of the Latin literature, which had before taken place in those universities, is, in every respect, degraded below its proper dignity, and sinks to that level of common illiteracy, to which, it is said (for it is not very probable), almost the whole of that Latin is now reduced.

The introduction of the Latin classics, therefore, in all universities, seems, upon the whole, not to be a very advantageous expedient, for increasing, in any degree, the quantity either of learning, or of knowledge in any country, but rather a hurtful one; for reducing it, perhaps, to the lowest degree in which any human wisdom and virtue can fall short, of what it naturally would rise to. It is certainly an expedient for diminishing, as far, perhaps, as it can, the value of those sciences, of those useful accomplishments of human life, of the most valuable part of human nature; and it is, perhaps (though it is by no means certain), an expediency equally pernable for diminishing the value of the other parts

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 322

of human life. The universities are now divided, not so very exactly, as they were in former times, but into five different departments, into which, it has been supposed, there are constantly shifting gradations.

First, are all the schools and institutions which are established for teaching theology and metaphysics; philosophy and ethics, too, though they have not, perhaps, been so carefully taught in them as in some others. These, too, though less numerous, are certainly of greater value. The study of theology has been, in every age and country, a matter of greater interest to the greater number than that of physics or of any other branch either either of natural, moral, or political philosophy. In every period of the world's history, the interest which religion has entertained, the veneration which it has inspired, has been, upon the greater part of men and women of letters, more durable and solid, than the interests and venerations which those sciences ever have entertained. Philosophy and ethics, too (though they too have been neglected by some), though less so in number, are, perhaps, equally valuable; and the neglect, it must be acknowledged (though it has never, I believe been very great), is much more perishable. In all ages, both of philosophy and of ethics, there has been something which was either useful, or at least interesting, to the great body of the people. The interest which these two branches have hitherto entertained has, no doubt, been somewhat inferior to that of theology, and to that of some of those sciences which, though less honourably paid, are equally necessary to every well-disciplined man. But it seems to be altogether impossible that either philosophy or ethics could ever be cultivated to a sufficient degree of refinement and perfection, to render those sciences worth the while of so many people as the other two. In all ages and countries, the study of philosophy and of ethics has generally been, upon the whole, a frivolous, a vain pursuit, attended with very few advantages, but frequently occasioned much trouble and anxiety. The interest which has been excited by those two frivolous studies, has been, on the contrary (for the same reasons), much more permanent and real, and of greater importance.

The other four divisions, of which the object seems evidently the same, though the order of study is not so, are those of law, physic, divinity and canon law; of which there is at this day

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 323

no uniformity in the universities of Europe, but which are divided, not only into many different schools, but into different professorships.
The law, physic and divination are the four great sciences, which compose the great system or fabric of human life, or the whole scheme of human happiness. But as the progress of those sciences has, in all ages, proceeded gradually, so has the improvement of the commonwealth of mankind, in all its different parts, from one degree to another, and from a state to one degree more improved.

In all ancient societies, both of men and cattle, every individual had some share of what was then considered a public function. The shepherd or the husband-farrier, for example, was his own shepherd, and the judge, the magistrate, and the priest of some church, was his own judge and the priest of some church. The sovereigns, and even some kings, were their own judges and the priests of their own church. The public offices, too, were generally filled by persons who were themselves private men. The judges in particular of some of their principal courts were, in all countries, the judges in particular, and in all countries the judges of their particular court, or the church which presided over them, or which had some jurisdiction in them, such courts of justice as were established in France, in England, and, I believe in every other part of Christendom. In those ancient times, the greater part of the inferior clergy were themselves private persons; as the presbyters and acolytes of the great church of Rome. In all those great courts of justice, the persons, who had any pretensions to learning, were always men of letters, and were not always necessarily attached to any particular order, sect or profession. The judges were generally men, too, who, in their own particular way of living, were either independent, or attached to some particular profession, such as the lawyer and the doctor, or some of those learned men who composed, with some honour, the principal ecclesiastical courts. In all those ancient societies, both the persons, who filled those public offices in the higher, and the persons, who filled the inferior ones, were all men of learning; but there was no regular education in the schools for the higher; nor any sort of discipline or subordinacy in the lower.

In those rude states, in those barbarous and ignorant ages, the sovereign, as long

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 324

he remained in possession of his own dominions, had no occasion to send out ambassadors or other ministers to foreign princes; but he could not, without a very considerable embarrassment, keep any one man, who happened either to be at home or to be a foreigner, from being employed as an ambassador or minister, in his own dominion. The sovereign, as long as his own people lived under such rude government, could neither defend themselves nor govern themselves; and it was necessary, therefore (to prevent their ruin) to entrust every thing in their government to some other person, who should have that power, and should likewise be their general. The greater part, or at least the great part, of all those other persons happened either to be foreigners, who were not himself natives of his dominions, and could therefore have no immediate interest to protect the people of the state; such as a governor, a consul or pro-consul, or a member of a military force, which the sovereign could not afford to maintain himself; or to have some interest, which he might not always be willing or able to give up altogether, to protect the inhabitants of those other dominions, and, by means of those others, carry out his own authority and authority over the inhabitants of his own. The greater part of them happened likewise to be men of learning and good understanding, whose wisdom and virtue, in proportion as they had the opportunity of learning or practising in those foreign countries, might enable them to better judge concerning the interest of their own country. Such were, I believe, almost the whole body of the ancient Grecians, as long as the Peloponses governed them. Such, too, were the ancient Romans, and the Greeks before the time of Alexander; and the republic of Athens was, perhaps, the only political society that was well calculated to prepare a nation of men, of whom, both knowledge and good sense, were capable, either to govern or even, if you will allow me the expression of an absurd notion, to defend the state. The Romans, accordingly (and, I think, the Greeks too, as long as they were under their kings), seem to have been, the greater part, more intelligent than any modern state. They were a people who, when their own country was at war with a neighbour, used to send out ambassadors to that neighbour's generals; to consult with them about the most advantageous way of resisting or repelring the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 325

enemy; to consult with one another about the best means either to defend or to attack the general; to consult about the most advantageous mode of dividing, either the land or the revenue of the country between different families; and to consult, too, about the means which it would be for their own advantage, if one or more particular individuals were put out from among them, to manage, either as a private man, or as a member of a particular body politic, in some other way than by being an elector, and by taking part in elections, as an individual member of the community, and not as a member either in a military or civil body politic.
The courts which they established in this manner in the countries where those courts were established, necessarily gave some importance and authority to such councils. In those ancient times the Roman people used sometimes to assemble in their cities, under their own kings, and under the government and direction either of one another, or of some other great lords or gentlemen, who were appointed by them. The Roman courts of justice consisted of several inferior courts; some of them, indeed, not courts at all, but merely sessions of the peace; and some of them, too, of no great importance at all; such as those of the tribunes and proconsuls. But though those courts had no importance at Rome, the Roman people still regarded them as of some importance at Constantinople. They seem to be mentioned by Cicero in this connection, as the judges of the senate who tried causes in the courts of law, though he nowhere names any particular person who composed them, or who directed them, though he seems to allude very properly to those who composed those inferior tribunals in Rome. The Greek courts, too, of judicature and administration, which were established in the different republics of Greece after the Trojan war (when they first took place), and which are mentioned by Homer, seem to have had some importance among the Greek people. The courts which the Athenians established in the cities, under their kings and other principal men, seem likewise to be of some importance.

The courts of law and of equity, which are instituted in the different states of Europe, have generally had some considerable importance among the people who live in the country where they take place. The courts of equity have always, accordingly (for there have been no very important courts of justice in ancient Greece), had a considerable authority in countries where there is no established government

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 326

. In countries, upon which the sovereign has neither any permanent capital, nor any revenue but what he derives from a revenue derived either directly from the sovereign, from some other source, or both, such as rents from a land-hold, or the like; such as Italy or Germany, in the present times. The courts of justice, therefore (which were originally intended only for settling such small differences of fact as could not well be decided at the great courts of justice in Rome and Constantinople), have naturally, in such countries, been more extensive than the greater part of them are at present, in all countries in which the administration of law and justice is properly entrusted to a regular administration. The Roman tribunals, indeed, had, in those times (according as we may suppose, according to some of those extravagant histories which have been written concerning them, or, according, to others which I shall not now enter into, and in which I do not pretend either to confirm, or even to justify), an immense authority, and were, in many respects, superior to all the inferior tribunes of the plebeian order. But though, in the Roman system of laws, the inferior tribunes were not judges at all, they had a sort of judicial authority; because the consul could not, without the consent of the whole senate and people of Rome, remove any of them from his office, without first obtaining it from them in the senate-house, and, if he attempted it, would be immediately deputed by it to a court of arbitration. In countries, on the other hand, where the judicial authority is not so properly vested in a senate, or in some sort of regular and permanent administration; where, consequently, no consul can remove any of the judges from their offices, without the concurrence of a court of three hundred judges; the tribunals, in the greater part of countries, having no jurisdiction to punish, except by a general court of justice; the courts of justice in those countries being, the one great courts, in which every individual is judge, jury, witness, and prosecutor in his own cause, without being liable either to the examination or the trial of the public magistrate. The courts of justice, accordingly (which were originally meant only for settling such small differences of law and fact which might not well have been decided by the greater tribunals in Rome), have generally had little authority. The courts of equity, on account of their being

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 327

continually filled with new causes, must be constantly in motion. The persons accused are not always brought before them in order to be tried; and the persons convicted may not always have had the time either to prepare their defence or even, upon some particular occasion, even the inclination or ability to do so. The person accused is not necessarily innocent, though the proof may be insufficient to convict him. In a court of justice, where every man has an opportunity of defending himself, he is much less liable to the injustice of any one man, than where he must defend his own cause by his silence, in a court of arbitration, where every man has the opportunity of making a counterbalance against him, either by refusing to take his case or, more frequently, by accepting a smaller sum.

In the different courts of equity established by the law of England for the trial of contracts, it has been found by experience, that, in many particular suits of this nature, it is better for all concerned, that the decision should fall upon one of those courts which, though they were always under the immediate direction and inspection of government, have no such immediate direction and inspection. In other suits, the courts which have such immediate directions and supervision, are more likely to decide justly, impartially and without regard either to party or judge, than those which have no direct inspection or direction from government. The courts of arbitration are not, like those of equity, constantly filled up. The greater part, perhaps, of them have never had any considerable cause to be.

In France, as in England the courts of justice are, in many cases (though, perhaps, still more so in the larger towns than the greater parts of towns in England), more corrupt and perverted than those of equity. The person who has been convicted in one, and who is at liberty to appeal, cannot afterwards, without exposing himself to much more danger than if he had appealed immediately upon his conviction (which is not always the case, but in most French jurisdictions), bring a second accusation, upon the ground of the misconduct or ignorance of the court in whose discharge he was committed; because he cannot afterwards bring his second complaint in that court. The courts of justice, therefore, are, in France, less perverted than in any other part of Europe. In England the corruption is still greater than in any part 


   

The corruption

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 328

of morals in every country is always the effect of some degree of poverty and degradation. In the lowest rank of people it is natural that those of the most advanced rank should be the worst affected. They are, in this case, exposed to the continual attacks and persecuions of every sort which can arise from their situation, and to all the vices and crimes to which the vocation which they have chosen exposes them.

The morals of those of the same rank with themselves are generally much more affected than the manners or morals of people in a higher rank. In every country there are some men of great learning who have never been able to make their way in any respectable profession. The contempt of such learned people frequently disposes the inferior ranks of men, in their conversation and actions both public and secret, to be contemptuous of such as come in their way.

The contempt of the inferior ranks of people is the effect of poverty, degradation, and oppression. It occasions the grossest rudeness, the most profane and offensive conversation; it turns men from the most respectable occupations to that to which the lowest common professions lead, the profession of pedagogue. It corruptes, too, the morals of those inferior ranks, which naturally lead, as it were, towards what they call the plain, and towards those to which the higher occupations lead, that is, to the more respectable professions; the occupations of men of business and the liberal professions. The man of letters becomes a man of business, the lawyer and doctor of law become lawyers, the rhetorician and apologist become orators, and those who study to compose or to read the law become attorneys, physicians, &amps.; and the grossest rudeness and offensive language, the most indecent conversation, are frequently used by those of the inferior ranks of men in the presence of such men as are of superior rank and fortune.

It was not so much because they were more ignorant than themselves of some of the most important branches of philosophy or of some of the more sublime sciences which are commonly taught in universities and college, but because their education had been directed, from early years, by teachers who had been either men of learning or of good standing in the world; that they had been more affected to those sciences than by those to which their own talents led them. They had, besides this, a certain natural superiority over the inferior ranks, arising partly, perhaps, from their superior rank in life and

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 329

fortune, and partly from the nature of their military exercises. The inferior ranks, besides, were not only unwilling, but incapable, even of opposing them, or of resisting them without gross indecency, or, at best, gross stupidity, upon the first introduction of those exercises into any of their own armies. In the ancient armies, besides the veterans, there were no slaves, who could be employed in defending the camp, and preparing and cooking the victuals for the soldiers; and the whole expense, besides this, which the soldiers paid to the king or the great lord, must have been very considerable. But the Roman soldiers, though not slaves, had, besides, the slaves of the farmers, who were, in those ancient wars, very numerous, and who contributed, besides, a good deal to their own defence. They were all maintained at the expense of the farmers; who, as they could not themselves defend the town against the enemy (for they could easily do so), were, upon that occasion too obliged to render assistance to those who defended it; so as that part of their own force which defended the town was not always sufficient to resist those who defended it.

The superiority of martial skill and spirit over that of wealth and birth naturally gives some sort of command over all other qualities; but in a militia, where the inferior classes, though they may be armed and exercised, are not necessarily under the command of their superior, it necessarily gives none over that of courage and constancy. The soldiers of a well-regulated standing army, on account of the great numbers and great activity of those inferior troops, naturally have the command of those superior qualities. But those inferior troops cannot well be maintained, but in the strictest discipline; because, without it, their exercise and arms become altogether unprofitable; and without it the whole body of those troops must necessarily be degraded and degraded, and must, therefore, be maintained by the voluntary contributions of a few individuals. The discipline, besides, necessary to give those few individualists that superiority, is itself extremely oppressive; because, in time of war and public danger (as in time of peace, when the people can seldom be disposed to give such assistance), every man is obliged to give an oath that he will support the state in war, and in time of peace, never to bear arms, except for his own defence, or for that purpose agreed to by his own private company, and under its immediate command,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 330

and without being liable to any examination or trial, or even any particular trial by a superior tribunal. The clergy are the only people whom the people are obliged to maintain during their whole lives, and who, in this case too (though they are not maintained by taxes, but by the fees of the clergy, which, as they amount to a very moderate revenue), are, upon that account, much more lightly burdened than any other order of people), must necessarily be more respected, and much more powerful, in times of national calamities. In such circumstances, therefore, the zeal of those few, who have been allowed, even under the ancient government of Europe (though under a more liberal administration), to practise, with impunity, every sort of injustice, is much more likely to excite, than to subside the popular indignation. The violence, therefore, which the clergy of Rome used to occasion, seems always to have excited more popular indignation than that which the soldiers employed against them. It was this violence, however, rather of which the ministers were the instruments, than of which the people were the victims; the violence of the one arising altogether from their private interest, of the other arising altogether from their duty towards the public.
The violence which the clergy of every established religion have ever occasioned has generally, in all cases, been the violence either of order and necessity, or of contending interests, of contriving some method by means of which, either the established church of the particular denomination, which is under attack (and it is always under attack), may, either by withdrawing, or by excluding all the adversaries from a certain place, either by withdrawing its own clergy from it altogether; by establishing a regular and permanent clergy; or by rendering it either altogether impracticable for them to withdraw their whole authority from the society into which they are established; or by some other expedient by which, either they or some other persons may be enabled, without incurring any burden upon the whole society, to maintain their own authority and jurisdiction with tolerable steadINESS and regular administration in a given locality; the violence of order and necessity arising in this last case, from the necessity, either to preserve or to increase the authority, or the revenues, or the influence, either of the church or of any particular patron or benefactor. The violence which the soldiers of Rome occasionED, was always, either of order and necessity or contriving some method of resisting the violence

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 331

which their sovereign might think proper to exercise against him. In the progress, too, of those violent revolutions, every citizen, whether Roman or German, became, by experience, a better judge than his father, who had been a plebeian, a plebe, and so forth, in the old republic. Every Roman became an expert in military exercises; and, from the knowledge which he acquired, the Romans became, through the greater portion of Europe (I mean, I believe, through the greater part of Italy, Spain and France), as expert as the Greeks and barbarians were before the foundation either of Rome or of any other European empire. In every country, where a military establishment has ever been established for defending a particular territory, every free citizen is obliged, in the first instance of all disturbances, to defend that territory by all the strength which he can command; and he is taught, by every kind of exercise, how to resist with dexterity, and with courage, every sort or kind 








Towards the end of the second Punici, and during the continuance of that war till the fall, of the Roman empire, every free citizen was taught to discharge the most sublime duty, the duty of defending, not only the person and authority of the sovereign, but, in the same manner, of the whole society. The citizens, therefore (for the soldiers were not always the citizens of the state, but of the particular city in which they served), became as perfectly learned in military matters as the best masters in any other science. The valor, both in battle, and in peace, was always more or lessthan in the ordinary degree; and every soldier was taught, in time, both to march with great steadiness and to fight with great valor. In the republic of ancient Greece, as well, the military service was originally confined to a particular city; and it was only afterwards allowed, with great liberality and freedom (for there were no other restraints but what arose from a regard to the public safety), to every freeman to exercise his profession either at home or in another city. In the ancient republics of ancient Rome, as well as in many other ancient states, the soldiers were not only exempted from taxes upon their own salaries, and were not bound in service to any private man, who happened at any particular time either either either to be or not to be a member of the state. They were taught to

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 332

despise, and to detest every thing that had ever been, or which might ever again become, connected with any superstition; to detests, for example, every sort of witchcraft; every kind of enchantment, and every art of making use either of birds, fishes or other animals, in order either of gaining money or of obtaining other favours.

Such was the general character, both of those sects which, from their doctrines alone (and there was nothing which they themselves did not teach, either expressly or by implication), endeavoured to exculpate, and of those which endeavoured either to confirm, or at best to explain, what they had been teaching about those doctrines.

But when, from the different tenets of those two sects (the fanatical and fanatical sectaries), one sect drew the conclusion, not only that there was no God, or, at least no one who had sent his messengers to visit men upon this earth, and to reward or to punish them for what they did in this life; but that there was not even a possibility that such rewards and punishments might take place in that state in which men are supposed to exist, it became necessary that another, more moderate, and, in its essence, equally absurd doctrine should be substituted in their place, in order to account for those extraordinary events, of the nature of which the human mind cannot conceive any possibility.

This doctrine, therefore (it has already appeared sufficiently), arose partly from ignorance and enthusiasm, partly, too (and no doubt partly too), from those passions of the human frame which are always ready, at any time and under any circumstance, either to support or oppose any new doctrine which is presented either to it directly or indirectly; but principally from those passions of ambition, interest, and vanity, which naturally arise from the consideration, not only of the great and extensive empire which the person who presents the new doctrines proposes to himself, but of his very considerable fortune, and of his very considerable abilities, as well as of the very great importance of those abilities, and of the very great honour which attends upon the success either of teaching, or of defending, those new doctrines against the attacks of all those adversaries who oppose them with every possible resource. The doctrine which arose out of the enthusiasm and ignorance of those times was called Pantheism, and it consisted altogether in a denial, not only of one of the principal articles of faith, of which the Catholic Church has ever

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 333

since acknowledged herself guilty; the doctrine of an eternal and unchangeable Deity; but, in consequence either either of the imprudence or impropriety of the fathers of that church (for it was not always their intention to deceive the world) of some other article of faith equally important, or, what came nearly about the same thing in both cases, both of them equally absurd; or of some doctrine equally sublime; such, for example, the doctrine of the immortality and eternal veracity of the human mind; and the improprieties of this system have been many and various, so as to afford a good illustration of how difficult it can sometimes be to reform a religion, even when the principles upon which it was founded are thoroughly well grounded. The austere and ascetic system of the Greeks was the original and principal system which the Catholic Church adopted. It was adopted in the greater part of the western churches, particularly by the followers either either of the Greek, or of that system of the Alexandrian school. The doctrines concerning the nature of the Deity, and the immortality and endless happiness, of which those of the Greek and Roman religions had taught the people (the former, at that particular period, probably from ignorance and superstition, the later from devotion), had excited in them a very strong religious enthusiasm, of the same kind with what we find among our own people in regard to many parts either either of the doctrine of the Incarnation, of the Deity, or of the Holy Spirit. The ancient Greek philosophers had endeavoured to shew, not only that the existence of such an object as a Deity was possible; but, more especially, how perfectly happy, and, in reality as well as in appearance, it must appear to the wise and intelligent; how perfect and independent, how perfectly just, just and fair; how free from every defect or fault whatever, whether in the Deity himself, or in any part of the system by means which had hitherto been devised for explaining or representing him, the great plan of the universe. They had not, therefore, been disposed to believe, as our own people are at present, in the trinity of the Deity, or in a future life. They were, however, sufficiently disposed to believe that, if there were any good and true gods at all (a point of which the Greek philosophy had made considerable progress), they must be extremely jealous and watch-ful of one another, and must, consequently, endeavour always, each of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 334

them in his own particular sect, either to destroy the other, or, if possible to subdue him. They were disposed likewise to consider the human form, and the animal frame, as objects of abhorrence, which it was necessary to guard constantly against; because the corruption which might happen to take place through any part either either either of the human or of the animal, would immediately occasion the ruin, either of that or of some of the other sects into whose midst that corruption might happen; the ruin, too, perhaps of all the sects which happened at the same moment to be possessed of any considerable portion either of the former, of either of those, or both of those, and of which the possession might be at the same moment threatened.

The ancient Greeks had been accustomed from their earliest period to consider, that whatever corrupted either of these two great principles would necessarily corrupt the state, or, what would be equally fatal to it both, ruin both. The state, therefore (according as they represented the state at the time) was extremely anxious, that no part either either either of human or of divine nature should be exposed to public odour and corruption; that every part should be so managed as either to preserve itself, or to be able afterwards, if necessary for that purpose to defend, and, if necessary to destroy, whatever had once become corrupted by such exposure. In this anxiety they were not, however, quite so unreasonable as the fanatics among us are frequently represented to have been, when, in the zeal to preserve religion, they were disposed, even by their laws and institutions, to overleverage the authority and jurisdiction of the state; to subject, for the support and defence, even the most sacred parts, even the most essential ceremonies and observances of that religion to a degree of arbitrary power, which could neither be restrained, nor even examined with tolerable exactness, by any law which the sovereign might enact.

It has, perhaps (for the Greek philosophers, who wrote upon political economy, had no written works of this kind upon any other subject), partly upon account of the natural aversion which every sensible creature has to what is indecent or improper to its species; and partly, too (and in this respect, as in many others, the doctrines of our European philosophers are much superior, though somewhat inferior to those taught in ancient Greece, both in logic, and in physics), upon account of their having been better acquainted with the operations of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 335

metals and other substances, than almost any of their modern successors. They had, besides, the advantage, not only of having had more leisure, but of being more familiar, both with the principles and the operations of the great sciences which have been propagated by the ancient Greeks, and of having been themselves, at an earlier period, engaged in the most profound and extensive investigations into these.
The Roman republic, it must always be observed (though the circumstances, both historical and geographical), in the course of the second century before the present, was in every respect a very flourishing and flourishing society, of which the arts and manufactures were gradually extending to every part of the empire; and it was in the progress of this progress, too, which gave occasion to some new and useful discoveries.

In the first book, I have endeavoured to show, that, in the ancient republics, as well as in all other monarchies, a considerable part of the annual produce, or even the whole surplus, of the lands, was destined for maintaining the civil government. This was the whole rent of all the lands, either in cultivation, as well as all the buildings which supported those crops. In those days, as in the present, the greater portion of that annual rent consisted, either in corn or pasture. The rent of buildings, however, was much lower, in the former than it was, probably in the present, and in many other countries than in Rome; and in the former, too (I mean, of those ancient times only), than the greater part of the present rents in the greater part of the towns in Great England, for example. The ancient republics seem never to have been much interested about the maintenance of their own armies. The soldiers, indeed (who had been educated, it is pretended, at the public expense) might have been maintained without them, but they had not been educated at the expense either.
The military force which maintained, first, that ancient constitution which established, afterwards that ancient law which regulated and determined the affairs both of the state and individuals; and, secondly that system of political and commercial laws which regulated, and afterwards, again that same military force; seems everywhere to have been maintained entirely by a tax or duty upon the necessaries and conveniencies of life, imposed upon every different sort or kind, of which the consumption, it seems to have seemed, could never exceed the demand. In those times (which were, in general

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 336

, very violent), it was natural to suppose that every man's interest required that he should have as much power as possible, in case he was to be employed in a hostile manner; and that, for the security and defence of that power, it was necessary that every man should, for his own security, be obliged to submit at all times to his lawful lord's authority. In this state, every subject was perfectly at his mercy, and had nothing but his life and liberty to depend upon.
The sovereign, who had the management of the affairs of the country under his command, had no other means by which he could either protect the subjects of his kingdom, or punish those who had committed any misdemeanour. The clergy, on the contrary (for the greater part of them were not priests at that particular time, but laymen), enjoyed a sort of spiritual authority over the people; and the sovereign was bound to listen to them with respect, and obey their decrees, even though he thought it better that the subject of each jurisdiction was left entirely at liberty.

In the progress of improvement, when arts, manufactures and commerce, gradually gave place to hospitality and the luxuries of table, the authority of religion became gradually more and more weakened. In the progress of decay, it was rendered altogether useless, and was either entirely abandoned, as at Rome and Constantinople, to some nominal or spiritual authority; or was degraded, as in England to what was called a bailiff or steward, who had only the power to punish those who broke the law. In both the ancient governments of Greece and Rome (which were founded, in the first place, upon religious principles, as well as upon other reasons), every subject, whether a priest, or a soldier of fortune; every rich merchant or artificer, was at his liberty, and was protected from all oppression, by the strict subordinateness and obedience, both of the church and the sovereign, which are the natural effects of the independency of each from the others.


 CHAP. IV.

OF THE RISE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATES.

 In every society there are two distinct interests, which naturally lead the sovereign towards the support and maintenance of the authority which is entrusted to him, and which naturally direct his actions in the support and defence of those two institutions; those of order, and of liberty, both of the subjects of his government, and of the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 337

subjects of other governments.
The support and maintenance, therefore of the authority, and the protection of the people, naturally draw towards themselves, in their own persons, two different sets of citizens, of which one is always interested to defend the established authority; the others to support, and to support, that which is supposed to be established against them. But the sovereign, in the same degree in whose favour that established power seems to lean most, must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the command, not only of a greater number of those who would defend, but of an infinite number of those, whose interest would be, if possible, even more to his interest than that of defending, the established authority. The sovereign is necessarily the principal, not only because he has the immediate care of the defence of his country, of the subjects whom it owes to him, of those who depend upon it for their subsistence, and for their authority and protection in their own society, but because he is the general, not of those, but of the whole society of the subjects.

The alteration, therefore, which the statute of apprenticeships proposes, though, from its very nature, contrary both in theory, and in fact, cannot fail to be unpopular, yet from the nature and circumstances of the case, it can be effectually prevented; and the law which establishes the alteration, can alone be considered as effectually established. The alteration, however, which it proposes, though, in the opinion either

Of the authors above mentioned, is not so much contrary to reason, as it is contrary to common humanity; and it may perhaps, without any discredit, even, upon the supposition that it is altogether effectual, be regarded as a good deal more so. The statute of apprenticeships proposes to establish in the young people, a certain order of things among themselves, which they may consider as perfectly agreeable to justice and equity; a systematical subordinacy of ranks, of ranks which are supposed to subsist everywhere, in all ages and nations of men, but particularly among nations who have never yet had any foreign commerce, nor yet any extensive commerce, nor yet any extensive intercourse with one another; an equality of ranks, in which every man feels that he is equal to every other man; an equality of privileges, of immunities which no body is supposed ever afterwards to lose, but only to gain by merit; an

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 338

inequality of ranks, of ranks, indeed which are not supposed ever to exist in any other country, or at any time, in the world. The statutes of apprenticeships, therefore (I have already observed what is meant by the word), were intended for the education, not of men, who, in every respect equal in their own nature, are in reality, very unequal, according to the system of their education; not only because, in every profession which is attended to, there must be a great deal of inequality in its management, but also because, in every other respect equal, they are altogether arbitrary, and frequently extremely cruel. In France, it is the opinion of many, even of those who have been long in the practice of it (I mean, of the greater part of the lawyers), that the greater number of people are really learned, but pretend, for the sake of employment and subsistence in some particular profession, to understand nothing but what is contained in their little volumes of instructions; that the greater number of men are actually very good scholars, who pretend not only not, but never, to read, write, or account themselves even half a man; that the greater number are really men, of good abilities, and of respectable birth, but are really incapable either of reading or writing; but are, on the contrary (I have already said), very eager to practise those arts, and very eager, besides, not only to deceive their masters about the most trifle, but sometimes even to commit the greatest misdemeanours, in the attempt to please them; and, in this, as in so many other things, the spirit and temper of the French lawgiver seems to resemble that spirit and temper of the ancient Romans. In the greater number, indeed, the professions of law, medicine, and divination (for those are among them principally cultivated by the children and grandchildren of the rich), seem to be filled up with a sort of learned gentlemen; but the number of those gentlemen is not sufficient to supply the place which is wanted, either in law or physic; and though the lawgiver has, in this respect, some advantage over the physician, he is not, however, much superior to other lawyers. The number of men of letters in all these different professions, is much greater than that in any one of the preceding; but the lawgiver has no more learned brethren than the lawyer has men of letters, nor is there anywhere a man, I

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 339

believe of more doubtful profession, than that eminent man. In France and England, indeed (I am speaking of those two nations only, which, it is evident, have not yet entirely recovered from this disorder), it has been thought necessary to lay some heavy burden upon the writers of poetry and prose. The ancient laws of France and England were extremely strict concerning this sort of literature, and the present government seems to have taken no pains to restrain it, but to aggravate the penalties of the old laws. The poets of both nations are now, I apprehend, very few, though there is no doubt much learning in them; for the same cause which renders it difficult, and even impossible, to learn any thing else. In the ancient state of France, poetry was not only encouraged, but rewarded with a great deal of honour. It was the original source, both, of popular and literary glory. In England, it has never yet obtained that popularity which poetry ever did in the times just mentioned, or even in the beginning of this period. The prizes, besides which are now given for poetry, are much less than in former times; so that, in poetry as in every sort of writing, it is much less likely that the work will bring back a reward equal, or nearly equivalent, to what was once expected from it.

In Switzerland, where poetry is not taught, and the greater part either of law, physic, or ecclesiastical history, has not yet been introduced, we have still some writers, who have acquired some knowledge in those sciences, but who have never attempted, even with their small talents, either to compose or to explain any poetry of any kind. Their works have generally, too, been published anonymously; so that no public praise, no popular review, no popular compilation has yet arisen from any part of their work, though several of their private writings, written with much less skill and ingenuity, and sometimes with the same spirit, have done so. In France and England, the greater part, I apprehend, even of those writers, have not yet acquired this knowledge.

In countries, on the contrary where poetry is taught, where the laws are favourable to poetry, and where it is allowed to all, it is not difficult to form any notion, either concerning the number and value of the works of each kind, or concerning the manner of their being distributed through the greater society, or concerning the probable degree, in which each of them contributes to the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 340

general happiness and good fortune, of the society in which they occur. The same principles, which would render a public or private scholar in the universities of Europe, an object of envy, and of detraction and derision, would make him a person to be envied, and even to be envied, if he was taught to compose in the streets, or to sing in taverns. In those disorderly, ignorant, and poor countries, the poets are everywhere very few and farbetween. The great and well endowed republics, on account of their superior wealth and splendours, have more of those great, well endowed and illustrious men than any other country. The emulation of those republics naturally renders some among them great poets, some statesmen and legislators, who have some share of popularity, influence and reputation with those of other countries, and consequently with the greater part of the people of other nations. Such is the emulation which naturally arises from the superiority which a republic has over every other sort of society; the jealousy which is naturally entertained against all those other sorts, of which it is itself composed. In those republicans, therefore, the poets naturally enjoy a much higher degree of consideration than among the people of other nations.

 ARTICULATES, OR THE PRINCIPLE OF DRAWN, AND NOT WRITTEN; OR THE DRAWINGS, AS WELL AS THE WRITINGS, CAN BE PROFITABLE.

Articles, indeed, of commerce are sometimes written, but seldom illustrated, or represented as they are in the pictures and statues of famous painters. The pictures and statuaries, therefore, who represent the person or thing represented as it really is in nature, have no opportunity of making their reputation in that way, and can scarce be distinguished even from common artists, whose works may frequently be represented in this manner.
The profit of the dealers in the articles, however (for the articles, as well, may be of different qualities), depends very much, it seems to me, upon the difference between the price at which they are sold in wholesale and that at which they are sold in retail, and, therefore, in what proportion the wholesale price bears to the retail price.
The difference between the price at which a piece of plate, for example is sold in wholesale, to the rich and the industrially employed man of fashion, and in which the merchant himself sells it to the poor labourer

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 341

and artificers for a very small profit; will naturally occasion a considerable surplus, or rather the whole produce of that surplus, being over-and-over again exchanged for a part of that which was originally paid for it, the wages of labour, the maintenance of productive labourer and artificer.

In a great country like England the whole produce of its agriculture is annually consumed and produced by a great number of different people. But in some parts only of it the produce is annually consumed and produced by a very small number of them, and those few are commonly maintained at a much lower rate than the greater part of other people. In the neighbourhood of London, and in the greater towns, there are generally but few farmers who can afford the expense and trouble of cultivating their lands. In the remoter parts of the kingdom, in some of the most uncultivable and most uncultivated counties in the north of England and in the north Wales, there is generally a great number. But the produce is consumed, and, consequently, produces, at least in part, no more than what is necessary to supply this small number, who are generally, too, maintained by a much smaller number.

The whole quantity of the rude produce, therefore, of land in the neighbourhood of London, must annually exchange for a much smaller quantity of that rude produce in those remote and uncultivated counties than it can in the more populous and more improved counties in the north of England. In order to supply this smaller number with this greater quantity, the price must necessarily be somewhat higher in the more populous, and, consequently the greater part of those higher prices being finally paid for the whole produce, or for what remains after defraying the ordinary expense of the farm.

But if the farmer, who has the command, had not been restrained from selling at the same price to all his neighbours, and from taking a share of the profits of all those who bought with him the produce of his own land, he would, upon equal quantities of rude produce of equal quality, have exchanged for a much larger quantity of manufactured produce, and consequently with a much greater profit. His own labour would, in proportion to his capital and stock, be more than double of that of the labourer who, without the aid of any stock of his, was employed upon the land. He would have been enabled to afford the maintenance of an additional number of hands; a quantity, however, still less,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 342

perhaps than what the country requires. The whole quantity, therefore, would be less, but the value more than it otherwise would have been.
The clergy of every country, it must be observed in passing, derive their whole subsistence from their own revenue, or what is annually levied upon them. The revenue of a layman consists in his wages and profit, together with his occasional or occasional gratifications. The revenue, therefore, which a layman can afford to his clergy, must be precisely in proportion to the quantity of his subsistence, or what he can afford to his wages, and must, therefore, always be in a certain ratio to the whole value of that surplus produce. It must always be more, therefore, than the quantity which can be annually maintained out of the ordinary profits of stock; and, consequently, than the quantity of labour which can be employed about the maintenance of this labouring force. It can never, therefore be less, and must always be sufficient for supporting the whole expense, both ordinary and extraordinary. It is this surplus produce, or this quantity of subsistence which the ecclesiastical establishment of Switzerland seems to require, in order to support the great expense, both ordinary, as well as extraordinary, laid upon its management.

In the cantons of Bernerne, Geneva, and Zülpichlin, where there are neither monks nor friars (the clergy, however being very numerous), every man pays in his own way the tithe or penny of the land tax; that is, every man, whether clergyman, layman, or free citizen, contributes towards defraying the expenses of this religious establishment. In those countries there is, besides, no other public revenue but what is raised by taxes upon the produce of property. In order to defray their own expenses, they are obliged to levy a certain proportion upon that produce; that is, the greater the quantity, or, in other terms, the smaller the value of it which they possess, they are likely to levy upon the people a greater or less tithe; that proportion which, according to them is just sufficient to defray the whole expense laid upon their management, whether public or religious.

The revenue of a monk, on account either of the poverty of his situation, of some peculiar circumstance of the order, or of some other cause, does not appear, upon the first examination, capable of maintaining any great number of persons, and of paying any great revenue towards

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 343

the public. It is altogether inadequate for this purpose. The monks of every order have generally, therefore (according to the opinion of one author, at least), no other revenue but what they derive from their own particular duties. They are, in general, a poor people. In the monasterIES of every order there are always, I believe (though this cannot be proved by any precise observation, but from general experience, and by the frequent accounts which we get of the state of those monastic establishments), a very poor set, consisting, in every respect, in menial servants and apprentices; and a still poorer, though a more numerous, set of women, both servants and apprentices, whom the abbacy itself, and all the other offices and duties of the church require to be fed and clothed. The whole revenue of those two classes of persons, however, is, in every country, sufficient, both for paying the salaries of the clergy, and for defraying the expense, not of the church alone, but for supporting the whole society of men, both of whom, it must be acknowledged, are maintained entirely, or almost entirely at their own expense. In the greater part of the countries of Europe, the church is, in this state, too weak to defend itself, either by arms or through a well-regulated militia; because, in those parts of it, the state, in the actual possession of the clergy, cannot be so powerful as it would be where there was perfect liberty. But in those countries which have become so wealthy by the commerce of the towns, the clergy are everywhere in a condition to maintain a very considerable military force. In the cities which are chiefly inhabited by the poor people, the clergy enjoy a sort of independency, of which they themselves are incapable of understanding or appreciating. They have not the spirit of an aristocracy; they have not the knowledge, nor the inclination to acquire it. Their situation, their situation alone renders them incapable even of understanding the situation and inclinations, of the great body of their poor subjects, of which they have no immediate care or attention. The spirit of an aristocracy is, in this situation of theirs, naturally to support the state. It has no natural tendency to do this. It is not their situation, therefore, which naturally renders them independent; it arises from nothing, and is altogether independent, and independent only of their situation, and the circumstances of their birth and situation, which render them incapable of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 344

being maintained altogether by their birth. The circumstance of their birth is the sole cause which can render them either independent or dependent.

It may sometimes be necessary that some persons, even though they should be naturally independent, should have some patrons or patrons, to enable their revenue and expense, as well as their other actions and conduct in life, either to maintain them, and to enable them to continue in good health to perform the duties of their station; and this necessity, too arises from nothing, and arises from the circumstance of their being naturally independent; but the patron is necessarily independent, though the person supported may not always be. It is the duty of the public to provide such patrons, as well for the maintenance of the independent members of every society as for that which maintains those of the principal members.

The English East India company, though originally instituted for the sole purpose of carrying trade to some distant market, soon found it necessary to extend their commerce beyond their immediate neighbourhood, and, by means of their colonies and settlements in different parts of the world (for they have now no less than twenty), to carry it to all parts of Europe, in consequence of the increasing wealth, industry, and improvement of those parts, which they had occasion for. Their revenue, besides, though originally derived from their trading capital, has, since their first institution (by act of assembly in 1600), gradually grown up to what is called their capital, which, as I have endeavoured to show in the fourth Book, is altogether distinct and distinct, independent, and independent only, from their trading capital, and from the revenue which it derives either from its own profits, from its own rent or leasehold, or from the profits and rents of their different branches of trade, as well as the interest of their stock. The revenue arising from their different branches of trade has gradually augmented in proportion, not only as their capital increased in the same proportion, or in the same proportion as their trade increased, or in the same proportion as their capital became more extensive; but, upon the contrary, in the contrary proportion as the number and wealth of their competitors increased. The whole capital of the company has, in this manner, increased, and their whole trading stock has increased in the same manner; but their revenue and expense, the two greatest parts 


  
The whole revenue and expenses, therefore, arising out of the different operations and employments of the company, have increased in the same

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 345

manner as their whole capital; the greater part of the former, and the whole of the latter, being annually consumed or put out in some other employment.

But the profits of stock are the price which must always be paid for employing it, in whatever manner it is employed, and they must always bear some proportion to the ordinary rate at which profit is usually paid for similar employments. The profits of the East India Company bear no proportion to those either of the Dutch East Indemnity or the French East India company. The profits of the East-India company are, upon that account much higher than they are even of some Dutch trading companies, of which, perhaps, they bear no proportion. They are, upon that account, somewhat lower than those commonly paid by the merchants and manufacturers of Amsterdam.

In consequence of the monopoly of the trade, therefore (the exclusive trade of the Company being what we call the natural monopoly of the colony trade), a greater proportion, both of the capitals and of the revenue, employed in that branch, has been taken from other employements. But this greater reduction of the competition has, upon many occasions, occasioned a very important augmentation in the revenue and profit of those employments. The monopoly of the colony trade has enabled the English manufacturers, and the merchants who trade to them by the coasting vessels of Great England and the West Indies, to raise their prices a good deal higher, than if they had been obliged to content their customers with the goods which they brought to market from the different settlements on their own coasts, and which were, therefore necessarily somewhat dearer than they otherwise would have become. It has enabled those same English manufacturers and merchants, by extending the trade, not merely to the East Indies, but to all the different islands and countries which lie round that immense ocean, to bring home to their respective colonies, not only more, but better goods than those carried to them directly from Europe, and to sell them again, with a profit, at least to those who come to purchase those goods from them directly. It has enabled the English East India Company not only to increase their capital, not only by augmenting the quantity of their annual exports and importations, but, in order to maintain their new settlements at a greater value, and to increase still further the quantity of the surplus produce which they annually export from India, to increase still further, not only their annual export, and importation, both the quantity and value

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 346

of those commodities, but, in order to keep their settlements in a better condition both before and after they are settled, they must increase, not only the value of the surplus, but the number of the unemployed, or of those whom the continual exportation of their produce is continually bringing to seek employment in some other employment. The increase of capital, it is evident, increases the productive powers of the labouring poor; and that increase of capital, by opening a wider field for their improvement, tends to improve still better, not only their condition at present (when they are employed in the same employment), and, consequently, the productive powers which they possess at present, but, at some future period (for there are many future periods, even though the employment is at present the same as before) the productive power both of their own labour and of the industry with whose aid they are connected, the productive powers of that great body of the people.
The increase of revenue from all these different sources may, no doubt, be considered as a necessary effect, though perhaps an accidental one, of that general increase of wealth and improvement which, during the progress of any long period, necessarily follows from the increasing population and improved productive powers, both in the society at large, as well in those particular branches of it in which commerce, manufactures, or foreign trade are carried

The increase in the revenue arising from land and from the produce either of domestic industry or that which is annually imported into a country, may, no doubt be considered as a necessary effect, though perhaps an accidental one, too, of this general improvement. But the increase of revenue from all the different sources of the revenue of individuals, from what proceeds altogether, or in the largest part at least, from their wages or their profits, is an effect, not so very accidental, but, on the contrary altogether necessary and unavoidable, and, and is, therefore, the natural effect and necessary corollary, both of the natural and of this general improvement.
The rent, or the neat revenue which remains after paying the wages of labour, is the only part of the annual produce which, it is to suppose, can belong altogether to one individual, or small number, of persons, without being exchanged for something else, or entering in any sort or form of circulation, whether as stock, as part of the annual produce of his industry or as

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 347

the rent of a landhold. The neat revenue which is thus paid annually to every individual, is called, properly speaking (according to our present ideas of money and credit), the annual produce of the land and labor of the country, or, more properly, what remains of the neat revenue of the society after paying, not the wages, but the rent and profit of all the lands, of which that particular country possesses any. It may be expressed by saying that its price, the neat revenue of the whole society divided between different persons or companies, is equal, not to the quantity which, at any one moment of time in the year, is actually paid by every single person, or company, who has any share in it, but to what, according as different accidents may render some of them pay more or less, it will be in all probability in all probability in a good many years together.

The taxes which at present, in different countries, are imposed upon consumable goods, are, strictly and exactly, all drawn from the rent of land. They fall upon those who possess, or, what comes to nearly same thing, the power of purchasing, the land. In France the greater portion of all taxes falls, not so much, as a fifth or a sixth part of the price of the goods, which are purchased by the consumers, and which is thus defraying the expense, both of the merchant, of the importer of the goods, of the retailer who deals in them, and of the manufacturer who prepares them. The rest, it is to suppose, go into the coffers, not only of those particular consumers and dealers in the commodities, but, as they are all consumers and retailers, into that general fund of revenue, into which, in every civilized country, the rent of the land must necessarily be finally restored.


 CHAP II.Of the Expense of the Revenue of the sovereign.

In the progress of improvement, every improvement, it is evident enough, increases, more or smaller in degree, both the expense and the revenue of every society, and consequently the power and the revenue, either either of that society itself or of those who live under it. But the revenue of a great kingdom is necessarily increased more by the expense of its public buildings than by the revenue of all its inhabitants. A tax of five hundred, perhaps, upon every inhabitant of the kingdom, would increase the power of no single person;

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 348

but would only increase the revenue which, in the long-run, would be destined for the support of the sovereign. It might, indeed (and it has been done before), occasion some degree of vexation and inconvenience to some of the inferior ranks of people. But, if the sovereign were a man of probity and good conduct, the greater the proportion of the tax, the less would be the chance that it would be abused; because, if the person who paid it was to understand that it was to go to him as a present for something which he had done or omitted to do; the person to whom he gave the tax being himself, as it always is, accountable for its application. The greater the proportion of the land tax which was to go to the support of government (the more it would be assessed upon houses and other buildings) the less could the tax, without occasion of any more vexation, be misapplied to those objects of expense which, though not actually taxed, are necessarily charged on every great nation.

In France, a very heavy land tax (three hundred and forty thousand pounds, at present), which, by an equitable division, is levied equally upon all estates of every rank, has not occasioned a single violation of any part of its terms. It seems, upon the whole, rather a reasonable and moderate revenue than a burdensome one; because the sovereign, in order to make it go towards his own expenses, is under an obligation to allow every citizen to pay as much, in kind, for his own tax as he thinks sufficient. In Great Britain the land tax, which, according to the accounts of the different officers, amounts at this moment, at an average of about twenty-two pounds a-year upon every man and servant, not only goes towards the expense, but is itself an object 

The land tax, too, in Great Britain and Holland, though it does no harm to the landlords and farmers, is said, upon that very account, sometimes hurtful and oppressive to the tenants and labourers, whose rent and wages, it is said, frequently rise so much, that they cannot pay what the landlord demands, but are obliged to content themselves with a part of what the farmer may afford them.

The rent of a farm is, like that of all houses, regulated by its natural rate, which, it seems, varies only with the variations in the crop. If the crop happens to

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 349

come in season during a war, the tax may sometimes occasion some loss; but, on account of the extraordinary exportation which it occasions, it must generally afford an advantage to the landlord. The rent of the lands, however (which, as we have seen in the fourth book, is the only source of revenue to which a tax can ever contribute towards the discharge of the public debt) must always be sufficient, not only to maintain the labour and expense of the cultivators, and to pay their salaries, but to defray, with the ordinary profits of stock (the ordinary rate being, in this case, five-and-twenty per cents upon a capital), the whole expense of the tax, including the interest and sinking fund, and, consequently, to afford, with the usual profits of stock, a neat profit to the farmer. If, by any accident of this kind, this neat profit does not amount, at the end, to one-third or two-thirds of the gross profit, the farmer must immediately feel some loss, and he is very apt to complain of the badness of the season. The tax must always be proportioned in this manner, not to the gross profit only, but to the neat profit, in order that, at all other times and circumstances, the neat profit may bear the same relation to the whole profit of the farm, as the gross to the half or the quarter of the whole profit. If it does bear this relative relation, it will be more difficult for the proprietors, when it is reduced to this degree of minuteness, to raise the rate of the tax beyond what the relative value of the neat profit bears to that of either of those two other relative values; because the loss which they must sustain in raising the tax above that degree, will more than counterbalance that gain of which they are in reality the gainors. The greater the relative difference, however (which, as I shall endeavour hereafter to shew hereafter, is necessarily very small), the less likely will either party be to raise this tax too high; and, in reality, this relative degree of difference, though it cannot be supposed very large, yet may be considered, in some measure, in the proportion between the tax and its real extent. In the different canton of Venice, there was a land-tax which amounted at one time to L.3 : 6 : 8 per cent. The produce of the different cultivated estates was divided into two

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 350

parts. One part, which consisted in the rent, went altogether to him, who had the management of the farm. His share of it amounted to a fourth or a sixth part only; that is, it amounted only to the produce of his labour. The other part consisted, in the same manner, in what is called profit. The landlord was obliged, in consequence, to employ the greater portion of it himself in maintaining, first the stock which was necessary for tending the farm, and afterwards, as the circumstances required, that part which had been over and above this necessary expense; the stock being generally maintained by the tenant. His profits, therefore, amounted, upon the average, to no less than six-and-twenty per cent. of the value, the rent being generally about five per cent. and the profit to no less than ten or fifteen.

In England, the farm-rent, which, before the Union, was at five per cents., is, according to the very well authenticated account of Mr Lownde, reduced to four, three, and two per cent. upon all improvements. It seems to have fallen still further in consequence, both of this reduction, and of what may perhaps have been the unavoidable effect of the late improvements, the improvement and cultivation of the lands. In 1764 and 1765 (1766 and 1812), Mr Lownde gives us a full account of the farm-land of the family of Douglas. It was improved, he informs us, in 1763, 1765 and 1766, and in the latter year was completely cultivated, according

 The account of his farm is, upon this occasion (which was made some time before his death in 1768), probably more authentic, and deserves the most careful examination.

In the year 1767 (1st of Queen Anne), Mr Lowndes account of that of the family of Davenant, gives a rent, which, according to him (which is, I believe, quite true), was about one-fifth, or about eight shillings in the pound of what had before been their farm-rent; that is to say, about twenty-five pounds sterling a year, or Ld. 4 : 8 : 6½, or eight

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 351

per cent. was added to this tax upon all the lands in England subject to a land-tax. In order that this additional sum might be levied in this manner, the old valuation of each acre of all the land in the country must first have had a deduction made out of it. This deduction was made either by reducing the original valuation, or, in some particular cases (for it is impossible to reduce the original valuation without reducing it somewhat more below its real value) by increasing it. The new assessment, therefore, which is levied in this manner upon all those estates, must be made in the same way. It must consist in a deduction from what is assessed at the original valuation. It cannot, therefore, exceed the original assessment, which, being made according to the old valuation, must be augmented by a similar deduction, or by an addition of a sum equal to the augment of that assessment. The lands of England which are subject to the land-tax are assessed and assessed again in the same manner, and in proportion to their former valuation, and must, in this manner, be levied and assessed again, in the same manner as the other lands.
The lands which are subject to a stamp-duty are assessed and taxed in a different manner altogether; the land which is subject to no other tax is assessed and assessed only in the same way as other lands. In order that this additional sum, therefore may, in all cases, properly be levied in this manner, a second deduction is necessary, in the same way as in the case of the land-tax; a second addition of a sum, not exceeding one-tentieth part, of the value of what was assessed in the old valuation. The lands of Great-Britain are assessed and taxed in this manner. They were assessed and taxed in a different way before they were subject to the stamp duties, which are assessed in a different manner still. In 1701, the valuation of the lands in the kingdom was as follows :-

Total Value.

Of the several classes into which this total value was divided, there were reckoned the lands of the Crown, of the gilds, and other public benefices, of which all the different rates were then assessed. The other lands were divided between different rates of customs, according to the nature of their situation, and to what might be called a local valuation; the rents of houses, for example, assessed according as they were within, within

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 352

a certain distance, of the town wall; or as the rent might vary with the variations in the market rate. In those remote and uncultivated parts, the landlord was obliged, for the security of his possession, not only frequently to give a rent, but sometimes to take one for the use of the landlord. In the neighbourhood of a great city, the sovereign, by giving the tax, not only enabled him to levy a moderate tax, but to secure the use of his own house to a tenant for ever, who would otherwise have had no interest to occupy it, and to enjoy it for ever.

The land-rents, which are the original sources from which all the different taxes which are at present imposed upon every different sort or class of goods, are ultimately derived. They are all originally advanced to the landlord, either as a free gift, as a quit-rent, or as a rent-charge.

In ancient times, the payment of a quit rent, like the payment of the land-tax, was always made to a private donor, who was, for the sake of the favour which he had procured for the donor, allowed to remain unmortgaging, without interest, during his whole term of occupancy. In England, where there is a very moderate quit-rent upon every acre of land (a circumstance which has probably contributed much to increase the produce of the land in that country, though, perhaps in part through the negligence and profusion of government), it seems not unreasonable that a considerable land tax should be levied, not only upon all the different parts of the farm, but upon every different part of the farm-yard, and upon all the different branches of the vegetable garden, and of every other part of the produce of the land.

A tax upon every different branch of produce would be a very unequal tax; and the contributors would not always pay the same rate of interest upon it. The produce, therefore, would vary considerably from year to year; and though it was paid in the end by the contributors, yet it might frequently take several successive payments to bring the contributor to the full amount of the tax. It is otherwise with land-taxes; which in England, and in almost all other countries, are finally paid by the contributors, in proportion to the value, not to the extent, either in the rent, in the profit, or in the rent-price.

The levying of such

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 353

duties is altogether arbitrary and unequal, as it depends upon the discretion of the collector, who may sometimes impose one tax, and sometimes a very heavy one; and it necessarily occasions the greatest possible inequality in the distribution, either of public revenue among the different members of the society.

In the ancient state of Europe, tithes were the original source of the whole ecclesiastical revenues. The clergy were the first purchasers of lands, and the most numerous purchasers. Their whole income, or, what came to the same thing, the value of their whole income, consisted, either in the price of those lands, or in the proportion which their tithes made to that price. The greater part of their revenue consisted altogether, or in some small part, of such payments as this. The land tax of the present times is the natural and unavoidable offspring, not only of such a state of things, which could have no other effect than to diminish, but to ruin completely, the whole ecclesiastical system which was established at the establishment and during a long period of time afterwards, both of Europe, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter, as well as of every part 






 THE WISDOM OF MAN, PG 354
The great benefice was, in those ancient times the sole source from which the great benefactor drew his subsistence, his maintenance and his glory, and the whole expense which he had for supporting his family. He was a man, too, whose person, though not of great beauty, was always of some importance, and whose character and fortune had a considerable degree both in grandeur and beauty, which, in the state to which he belonged, would alone have entitled him to great respect, and to be revered as an illustrious ancestor, or as the founder of a noble family. The state of Europe was then approaching towards a much more opulent and splendid state, than what has been arrived upon it at present, in spite, perhaps, both of the oppression of feudal law, which oppressed, in some respects, every member of that order, as well in the manners as in the laws which governed their government, as of the continual convulsions of the great body of the people. The clergy were the first purchacers of lands. They were the first who acquired property in land, either by purchase, or as tenants under leases, who, therefore, naturally derived a considerable revenue from it. Their persons were of great beauty, their situation, too

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 354

, agreeable; and the expense, instead of being raised by taxes upon the produce of land, or of some sort of rent paid by those who lived in it, was commonly defrayed by what is called an easiness tax, which was paid only upon such improvements as could be carried out of the neighbourhood. The greater the quantity of such improvements that could thus be removed from the neighbourhood, and distributed among the people, the more convenient it would be for all those who lived in it to live in the same neighbourhood. Such were the villas of the great families of France, the chateaus of Charles IX. and Edward IV. and their immediate neighbourhood, of Flanders and Antwerp, in all the countries in which those houses still subsist; and such, too (though they have not been very numerous), were many of the country mansions of the rich and the famous in ancient Rome.
The operation of the easiness tax was, in all cases, to diminish the real value of what had before been a real rent, or the money rent of land. It reduced the real price of houses, and thereby discouraged the increase, both in the number and value of those houses. It discouraged, likewise, that increase in their neat rent, which is always the effect, not of any rise in the value of those houses, but of the diminuency, not of their neat rent, as we shall see hereafter, but in that of their real rent.
The rent, indeed (for it is the price of the whole annual produce, and, consequently the real produce, which must bear any regular proportion to that price) must always bear a regular proportion to the value of that whole annual produce, and must, therefore, bear no proportional proportion to the tax upon the neat rent. The tax upon house rent must be paid, not by the owner of the house (the landlord) who lives in the neighbourhood, or, what would properly belong to him, the neat rent, but, in all cases, by the tenant. The neat rent must bear a regular relation to the tax. The tax upon a house, though it should be sold at auction, must necessarily be paid by its inhabitant, the purchaser; the tax must be paid, not by his creditor or creditor's agent (who, in all cases, pay the interest or the commission upon it, together with the usual rent and profits of stock in that trade), but, in all such

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 355

cases, by his real proprietor, or the person to whose possession it properly belongs. The real proprietor is the person, or persons, to whom it properly belongs, either as an immoveable or an immoveable property, or both. The revenue, or, what comes to the like purpose in the same manner, the price of the land which it affords, is paid to the real proprietors of that property, who, as they possess it by occupancy, are the same with those who actually occupy and inhabit it, or with the persons to whom it really belongs, as an immoveably or an imperceptible property. It does no harm to any body, and, if it is properly assessed and collected, does not affect any one very materially.

Taxes upon houses, when they affect houses of public resort, are, upon most occasions (for the same reasons which would render a tax on houses in private families, a very unequal and hurtful tax) altogether unequal and hurtful taxes; because they are imposed, not upon the inhabitants of those private houses, but, upon the persons who live in them. The person to whom a house is legally assigned, is necessarily bound by the assignment, either by the original grantor of the land, or by the subsequent purchaser. But the persons, or persons to whom the land is legally transferred, can never, without some injustice or violation of the most sacred rights of mankind, transfer their occupancy from the grantee to the purchaser. They may, however (by writing a deed of alienation, for example), convey their right to the person to whom it belongs; and this transfer is always valid according to the laws of the country where the deed of alienation takes place. But if a house tax were to be imposed upon such transferrers of occupancy, it might be very justly supposed that they themselves were the true tenants of that house, which, being assigned to them, could give no right to another.


The proportion which such a house tax ought necessarily to bear to the whole rent of the estate, depends, in every respect whatever, upon three circumstances: First, upon the rent which, according to a particular mode or system of valuation, is usually advanced to a house; secondly, on the proportion, both of that rent to other rents in the same manner, and to all other taxes; thirdly, upon the proportion, which, according to a different mode of valuation, the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 356

whole value of the house, including the ground rent and the repairs and improvements, bears to all other values in the same way.

In the system in which I am accustomed to believe, the proportion which a particular house tax, or any other land tax, ought necessarily to bear to all those other taxes, depends upon these three circumstances only. It does, however, appear, that the proportion, both of that tax to the rent advanced to a house, to the whole value, both of the land which is advanced, as in the Dutch and French systems, and of what is laid out upon repairs, is not always equal to this third circumstance.
The rent advanced to houses in England seems not to have been assessed in the same proportion as in Holland. The Dutch system, indeed, requires that every house should, under it be assessed, either as an inhabited house, with its proper share of ground-rent; or as a house of sale, with its ordinary share of rent, and no more; but that the assessors, in order not to give any advantage to a house of sale, should allow a certain portion only of the land-tax, which is paid upon houses of that description, and that this portion, instead, as in the Dutch and French systems, of a certain portion of rent, ought to consist, first, of a small annual payment, of two shilling and sixpences a-year upon every ten acres or half-acre of land in the kingdom, and, secondly, in an annual payment equal to the value of the land, which is allowed for houses of that description. The rent, in the English system, is allowed as a separate charge; but as it does no part either of the capital, or of the maintenance, or of any part of the profits of the inhabitant; as it falls altogether upon him as his master, as the proprietor of a particular portion of the land, it must evidently fall somewhat short of this third circumstance, which is peculiarly applicable to houses of the first kind, and which would necessarily render the tax more just, and consequently the assessment more equal, of houses of sale than of inhabited ones; because it would not be sufficient to pay for the maintenance and profit, which the proprietor of a house of sale ought to have, but likewise the interest, the insurance and all other ordinary charges, arising out either from the use of the house itself, or from its being occupied by people

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 357

. The house of the farmer must be insured; the farmer's share in the produce must belong to him; and he cannot afford to insure it himself. The insurance is always contracted by his neighbors; and the whole rent of the farm is a charge upon the whole neighbourhood; and, as this neighbourhood cannot well be divided among many small proprietors, the whole tax, too, will necessarily fall somewhat short of what is necessary to discharge the expense, both to him, and to all the other tenants of the farm.
In the German and Austrian systems, houses of sale, though they are subject, as well as all other inhabited buildings to a tax, are taxed at a lower rate, according to their respective values, or according to their supposed proximity to the dwelling-house. The house, however (for the sake of simplicity, we shall call it a house of sale) is considered only as the portion of land, which, it seems to think, ought to belong to the seller. It pays, therefore, as little as the most fertile and best cultivated land, or, what is the same thing in reality, as little as what is equivalent to its own rent. The rent is allowed, therefore, to be a separate charge, and falls altogether, as well in the German as in the Austrian system, upon the person, or upon some other person, whom the house belongs to. The house is insured; and, as it pays the whole rent to the person who occupies and possesses the whole estate, the insurance is likewise paid entirely to him, and is, therefore, likewise a distinct and independent charge.

In France, houses of the best description are subject neither to any rent nor other tax, but to a small duty of four or five per cents upon their purchase, and to a still lower duty upon the sale of the whole property. The house is assessed, not upon the value which is commonly paid for the land, but upon what is supposed to be equivalent to it. Houses, it has been said, of this latter sort, are generally of very bad build. They are not always of good condition. The great number of them, and the small extent, which renders the inspection of each house very easy, render it frequently of very little value, and frequently of no value at all, to the owner, and frequently of much less value than that which would have gone with the land, had not the owner chosen to live upon it. Houses, it

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 358

is to be hoped, are not the objects of so great an attention as the stocks which they contain; and the stock, it has already been observed, though the greater part of the inhabitants of every great country have some stock, is by far not the greatest part. A tax upon houses, it has likewise already been remarked, would not necessarily occasion the decay of any particular sort or kind of house. It would be applicable, however, in the same way as the stamp duties, to the whole class of houses, whether houses of rent or not.
The tax upon the stock which a private person possesses, or which is held in trust for him, might very well have the same effect upon that of the inhabitants of his neighbourhood, though it might be imposed at a much smaller expense. The people would be taxed for what they had no interest in, but only in what was their proper business, the management and improvement, not of their own particular houses, but of the whole stock of houses in their neighborhood, or of the stock of the country as a whole.

The land-tax of France has been proposed by some people as a means of paying off the debt of the crown, and of making good what has been lost in the late war. But the real wealth of the country, the quantity and value both 




 Of all the materials and finished work which can annually be brought into competition with it, the greater part of it must always fall to its rivals, who would be much more likely to pay with a part, than with a great part, of that part which they had of their share of the produce of its labour.

If the greater part of the inhabitants of every country had some stock, the greater part too, of that which was in them would be in the hands which possessed it. If the land tax were to fall upon the whole stock of every private man in every country, the greater, not only of what was in their own hands, but of all that was either held in trust or employed as stock for immediate consumption, the stock which was in their neighbours' hands might very well be diminished, and the trade of those neighbours might very well suffer. It is not very probable that a small tax upon houses, which could be applied, not so much to enrich as to discourage, those who had stock to keep, and who were likely to be overburdened with it, would have this effect

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 359

.

The same cause which, in Holland, occasions a tax of one hundred and fifty guilders, or about six shilling a-week upon all houses over ten pounds rent, occasions a very heavy tax in Hamburg, which is supposed to amount to three thousand five hundred guilders, equal to one hundred and fifty pounds sterling a-month. This tax is imposed only for defraying the expense of a public highway, a public market-place, and a police-station; for the maintenance of a few soldiers, who are there kept at no charge, but who have their subsistence from the public revenue; and for what purpose, I cannot pretend at present to know; for the reason that I never was privy to the deliberations of this board. The people who pay it are, no doubt very poor people, but very poor, too, in the common sense of the word, which signifies, not so much poverty as meanness. They are, however, a very industriously managed people. They cultivate their land, they make their clothes and household furniture, they manufacture their goods of all kinds, in order that their revenue, though it is not great, may be considerable. Their revenue, indeed is but a third of what is usually drawn by such high duties in other countries. But in a country so rich in manufactures, it is not likely that they could afford to pay so heavy a tax. It would, besides, be more convenient, they imagine, for them to pay this tax by a certain proportion, by a particular sort or sort or kind of money, which, they say, is not liable, like other money, to be counterfeited.

In Switzerland the taxes upon houses are said to amount, at the present time (1864), at twenty or thirty per cent. of the rent. This, it is acknowledged, does, indeed, exceed somewhat the rate of other countries; but the canton which imposes this tax seems to have the reputation of being one of those provinces of Europe which are always in a state of poverty, and of which the inhabitants have always a great fondness for a good house, a good wardrobe, and an excellent kitchen, though they are generally but ill paid. In the greater part, indeed, of the cantons of Swiss territory, the tax upon houses is not very heavy, and it is not very easy for the proprietor to get back his tax by the rent. The people of Zurich pay

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 360

five guilder a-year to the king, to be employed in maintaining the king and his family. They are, besides, supposed, to pay an annual fine, amounting at present about six hundred thousand flors, to be levied by the police at the king's request. This fine is supposed to amount to more, at present, than ten per cent. of the gross produce, or of what the king can afford to maintain his whole court.

In Holland there is a sort or tax upon houses; and this tax has, upon different occasions, been very moderate and inconspicuous, as it was never intended to be so. It has sometimes been raised, and has sometimes been allowed to fall back upon those who paid it, in the proportion which suited best the state of the finances. The house-tax in Holland is not supposed to exceed ten per cent. upon the gross rent of houses; and this is considered as a moderate and inconspicious sum. In some provinces of France, houses are valued at three guilders the square foot, which is supposed to be about four times greater than the ordinary price in England. The tax of the republic, however, which in 1755 imposed this sum, was supposed to amount to more than twenty per cents. upon the whole value of the house, or to three-fifteenths, the twentieth part of the whole price. The house-tax of France has been much greater, both in proportion to the rent of houses, as well as in that of the country. In 1759 and 1760, a law was enacted, obliging all the inhabitants, both of town-corporate, and of the country villages, which were not exempted, either from this general tax, or from some other particular one; and in 1763 the tax upon houses was augmented by another twenty per cents. In order, however (for this enhancement was thought necessary), to prevent the abuse of this enhancement, a considerable part was drawn back, in the proportion of one per cent. upon the whole value, both of houses and of all other buildings. This law has, however, had all the bad effects which can well be imagined; and the house tax, though it has been greatly abated, yet continues at its present height of twenty-one and one half per cent. The abuses, too (which, I am afraid I cannot avoid mentioning, are everywhere too familiar), the arbitrary and unnecessary exactions which are made

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 361

of every citizen in the execution either of the laws or the regulations of the state; the continual and unaccountable visits made to every private house, and the innumerable taxes which, though levied in order to defraud, are frequently exacted with a sort of insolence which seems to mock the most cruel oppressors; such things, in a civilized country, are not easily remedIED, but require, in most cases, some long and tedious process, which, if it were possible to do without it, would probably be very soon brought about.

But though this inequality, this injustice, this malversations upon private rights, must necessarily have some effect, though perhaps not so very great one way as it could be otherwise, on the general happiness or misery of the whole country? I answer that it is not so much the inequality of the taxes which, so far as I know (I have no reason to suspect the accuracy of the public revenue accounts), are levied with the most exactness and fidelity in France, as the inequality of their application.

The taxes which, in France, fall heaviest upon those of the rich, fall heaviest upon those of the proprietor; upon those of those who live in the town or the country. They fall upon those whose real or supposed revenue is greatest; and the proportion of those who are taxed is necessarily greater than that who pay the taxes, because the former must always pay a greater proportion to his revenue. The taxes upon the rent of houses are generally higher than any other. In France they amount to three or four per cent. of what the inhabitant can reasonably be expected to pay, without encroaching too much on his revenue, or burdenerating him too severely. But the taxes which fall hardest, and which are paid almost altogether by what are called artificer and manufacturer families (for they do not, I believe, extend so much beyond those two classes) fall almost entirely upon those who have the least to spare. The proportion of those taxes, therefore, falls heaviest upon the poor, and gives some encouragement to their industry and frugal living; while it gives none to that industry and expense of the rich. It encourages the latter, in the one case, to spend upon the pleasures of luxury, in the other, to employ the savings in the maintenance and employment of idle, beggary, and wretched menial servants. The taxes upon the rent and profit of stock, too, fall equally, and give some

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 362

encouragement, either directly or indirectly to the increase of stock.
The vicesimus pollux are levied at the same rate, though in different places, and with very different penalties. In France, they are levied in all the different towns of France, at a much smaller proportion than in any part of England; in the province, at least in the greater part, of the kingdom, they are very seldom exacted. In some provinces, particularly in those of Lorraine, where the principal trade of the country is carried on by merchants of the foreign stock, they frequently are exacted; but they seldom amount to more than half the value, which must generally be found among the traders in those parts of England which trade principally to foreign countries. The vicesimus pollux are not levied in England in proportion to their real rent. The vicesimus tax in England, therefore the vicesimus pollux in the greater part of English ports, may be computed, without any loss of revenue to government. The vicedome tax, however, is levied very much more sparingly in England than anywhere else. In some particular places, it is said to be at five per cent. upon the value of goods imported, though in others it is at two, one half and one third per cent.; and it is seldom exactED there, though sometimes it may happen, by accident, to fall on goods of some sort of consumption, of the most common kind, such as provisions and household goods, which cannot be brought from other countries. In the greater part of the ports of Great England, however (I have never been assured that any part of it is exacted in any of them), it is always exacted upon the whole value, whether of the imported or of those exported.
3. Taxes which are paid indifferently upon the Rent of Land, even though they do not reduce the real value either either of land, houses, or labour, in any one of those different ways which can reduce the real price of the necessaries and comforts of life, yet, in proportion to what they reduce the real price of any one, reduce that of all the rest. The rent of land, for example, is a tax upon the profits of stock; the rent, however 




The rent of land, therefore, is not a tax, even though it reduces the real price both of stock, houses, or labour.  It reduces it only, so far

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 363

as it depends upon the value of the coin. If, for example, the value of silver was reduced by two per cent., the duties upon the importation of foreign silver would be raised from two to three per cent.; the coin would become worth only eight shillINGS the ounce; and the duties upon the importation would fall from six to five. The value of all other commodities might be supposed to remain the the same, and the quantity of silver in the coin the only difference between them.
The reduction in the coinage price is, upon most occasions, a temporary expedient, to be taken off and on again as soon as the scarcity or plenty, which the scarcity or cheapens the scarcity occasioned by the sinking or raising money. It is not the real price, but only the nominal one, of which the real price necessarily regulates that of every other price. When, by a sinking fund, the value of silver was reduced by a half, the coinage price would be L.5, and that of gold only L.; but the real value of all commodities being the same as usual, and the nominal value of the whole coin only being increased by the half, the quantity in the coin being the same as usual, their price must likewise have been the only one which could really be affected. The reduction of coin price is a very important expediency; because it saves, in many cases (for the coinage price of all metals, except iron, is regulated by this principle), a very considerable quantity of the precious metals, which might otherwise have been exported, or stored up in warehouses.

In England the coinage is not always proportionable to the increase in the demand for coin; and in times of general scarcity it is sometimes raised by extraordinary taxes; as, for instance, in the reigns of queen Anne, and of her great-granddaughter Queen Elizabeth.

In France the state has not yet been able, consistently with liberty and justice, to establish, with any tolerable exactness (for the state cannot do better), a uniform and unvarying system of coinage, of equal weight and value, throughout the kingdom; and in some particular districts, there is a good deal of variation in the weight and value of their respective coins. In those particular districts, the king's taxes are paid with the coins of some particular mints; and in others, they are paid with those of the other mints, at

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 364

the rate of a halfpenn' sterling upon every twenty shillINGS value.

Taxes, therefore, upon what may be considered as luxuries, are levied with more difficulty than upon the necessary necessary parts of life, which, being the property of private people, can seldom be the subject either of taxation, or of particular attention of government. Taxes upon such luxuries, indeed, may sometimes be imposed by a particular statute. In Holland it is the general rule to lay all taxes upon the necessaries of the life. The greater part of those duties, therefore, may be regarded, not as particular burdens imposed upon particular people, but as a part  of the general system of the common revenue of Holland, as a part, too, of the general expense of government. They are levied, therefore, not with so much care, as those upon other parts of the necessaries of life; and it frequently happens, that, in times of great scarcity and calamities, the greater part of those duties, which, though originally intended to be a sort of bounties upon the production of particular sorts or classes, become, upon that produce, in the actual circumstances of the country, burdens upon the revenue of all its inhabitants.

The same causes which, in Great Britain, occasion the greatest exportation, contribute, it seems, to render it, in times of moderate plenty and plenty, the most expensive of all foreign luxuriances; the high wages of the workman, the great distance of the place from the seat where he resides; and the great expense of shipping and of inland carriage contribute, in this respect too (though not in the degree of so much other expense), to make the foreign luxury, of which Great-Britain produces no great surplus, the most expensive in all the world. It costs the nation almost double what the produce of its own lands and fisheries could maintain, in times of equal abundance, in the same manner as it costs the farmer nearly double the price of the produce of his land. The whole annual expense of foreign luxuries in Great Britain, it has already been shewn, exceeds, by about two hundred thousand pounds, the whole yearly consumption of the people. This sum, therefore, is not only sufficient for maintaining all those who consume the greater part, and for paying all those who consume the smaller part, of this whole expense, but it affords, at the same time, a very considerable revenue to government,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 365

and enables it to carry its workmen, both day and night, to the utmost diligence. It would be ridiculous, indeed (for I have already endeavoured, in several different ways, to show how absurd soever the notion of revenue is), to pretend that a tax upon bread could raise the wages or diminish the profit even of the baker; because it is impossible, in the nature and circumstances of things, to diminish either the quantity or the quality of bread. The person whose revenue is taxed cannot reduce his price, and consequently his profits; because the tax must always raise the price, either immediately, by the substitution of another tax, which will replace it to him in a less sum, or after a longer time by a rise of wages. But the person whose bread is taxed can reduce his price, and therefore his profits, by not purchasing so cheap an instrument of labour. His profits are reduced, not so much by what the tax does, as by what he does not purchase; and this diminution of profit, it has already been observed, necessarily tends to lower the price of all goods, both of the consumer and producer, as well as to raise the wages of labour. It is this rise, not of wages only, which lowers, or keeps down the wages and profits of labour, in proportion to what they might have been, had wages continued their natural rate; and it raises not only the wages and profits of the labourer, but all other labourer, and every other consumer, above what their nature would otherwise require, had the price, the real recompence, of their work, been left to fall where it naturally would.
The natural tendency, therefore, of the tax to lower the wages of the inferior ranks of labour, is the very same thing which makes the superiority of their revenue, and enables government to carry its workmen, day and night, to that diligence to which it is capable, though with a smaller quantity and a smaller quality of work, and with the ordinary rate and recompense of profit, than they otherwise would be able to afford to do. The superiority, however, in this respect seems to be altogether imaginary. It has frequently been asserted by very intelligent people, that a tax upon the necessaries of life would raise the wages and improve the condition of the inferior ranks, by enabling them, with more ease and comfort, to perform their duty, and contribute to support the authority, and to defend the public liberty of the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 366

society.
The most effectual engine for raising the wages and improving the condition of labour is a tax upon the profits of stock; because, as every such tax necessarily raises the price of labour, so it necessarily lowers its profits, and enables all those who are subject to the tax, either directly or through their representatives, either to purchase or to hire cheaper, the commodities with which they trade, and consequently to increase their consumption. The wages and profit of labour, however (I have endeavoured, in the first place, to show in what manner the different taxes upon necessaries of life tend to diminish the industry of artificors), must be paid by some other fund than by a tax upon the profits of stock. A tax upon wages and profits, it has been shown, can never be proportioned to what may be necessary, for the support and defence of the society, for that purpose, either to the revenue of the state, or to what can easily be drawn from the stock of the individuals composing it; and, therefore, cannot raise those wages or improve the condition, of any but those whose stock contributes nothing towards that defence or support. It is upon this account only that such taxes have ever been thought proper.

A tax upon the wages of labour, though it should be proportionable to some fund, yet if any considerable proportion of the people, either of the state, or the individuals composing it (for the state cannot draw upon any one of those three different sources for the payment, either of the tax or the other two expenses which it imposes upon them) should employ the greater portion of this tax, not in maintaining the industrious poor, as labourers, artificors, or servants of every kind, but in employing some of their own children in useful, or even in ornamental trades; the children, no doubt, would be industrious; the parents, no doubt, industrious; but neither of the two sexes equally so; because, in the first place, the labour of a child is not of long continuance, and, in the second, it is much more difficult to get it through the necessary education and discipline to become a good mechanic, than to get a wife or a husband through that education. Such a practice might, no doubt (though it would be a bad one to attempt), be practised in a few years, and would, perhaps, in the course of the present century, be universally adopted, without raising the wages

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 367

of labour, or reducing the price either of provisions, or of the rude produce of land, in proportion as it was carried on. The expense which this would occasion, would not, in the smallest degree, affect either the revenue, or the productive powers of labour; and though it might reduce somewhat the revenue of government, it would have none the less the greatest possible influence upon that productive power. It might even, in the course of this century, occasion a considerable reduction of the expense of government.

Capitation Taxes

The capitation tax, so far as it affects individuals, has been the favourite instrument of all tyrannies. The ancient Roman capitations, the feudal taxes, all fall within this general class of taxes, of which those in France, and those which, in England, are said to have given birth to those which, under their modern forms, we are now familiar with. In every stage, however, of their existence and operation, the capitation taxes have been attended with very great inconveniency. They were always, therefore, more burdens than advantages. The most oppressive, perhaps, was the Roman tax of two per cent. which the senate enacted against the plebs, upon all those who were subject, either to the Roman law of blood-revenue (for which purpose they had been taxed in the time of Claudius), or to that part of the Roman constitution which regulated the election and payment of such of the tribunes as had fallen under the influence of that law. The plebs had been, at that particular time, taxed in two different ways; first, by a poll tax of two per cent. upon their own votes, and, afterwards, by another poll tax upon their consuls. Both the poll tax of two and two-and-twentieth pence a-vote, therefore, amounting at present to about sixpence, amounted, in this constitution, to more than L.3,000,000 a-head, and, at an average, to one-fifth, or one half of that sum, which would have been sufficient for carrying through all the elections. The cap. upon the vote, however (the poll of one's district being equal to one vote in the general election), amounted to no less than L.2,000 a head. In order, too, that no man should have an opportunity of defying his tax, the poll-takers were obliged to keep themselves constantly

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 368

under constant surveillance. The duties upon bread and ale, and upon all other luxuries, were, for these purposes (and no other), called post-office duties; and the poll-takers were obliged frequently to pay particular visits to those whom the custom-house officer thought it proper to tax, and who happened to be in his neighborhood, or in the neighbourhood of any of his superiors.
The custom-house officer, it must always have been remembered, was the real gatherer of taxes; the person, whom, by the natural course, every man would be glad to see go away, and leave the revenue free and unmortgaged. In those times, the revenue, indeed (for the state was but a small proprietor), was levied chiefly through the greater part of the different town magistrates. The greater number of them, therefore, might be expected not only not always, but not seldom, not only to attend, but frequently, even to understand the business which was being transacted in their neighbourhood. The duties upon malt, beer and ale (which were, for these purposes, called excise duties), and the several poll-taxes, were all paid by those who brewed or drank them.
The revenue of the different towns and parishes of Scotland is said to have amounted, at an average, at that time, to more than a million sterling a year; that part, therefore, of the whole annual expense which must, it was pretended (by Mr Law, in 1736, though this account seems rather to represent a mistaken recollection), be laid out, not in building and repairing the public works which the different sovereigns had occasion for, but, on the other hand, in the maintenance of a police force, in the expense of a militia, and in the maintenance of an army, of which the principal strength consisted in a bodyguard of mounted troops; a force of which the maintenance, besides the ordinary salaries of its officers, amounted to several millions of pounds annually; and a service of such a nature, it must be supposed, as would not fail to attract, not a few of the most respectable citizens, either of Scotland, or of the dominions which were under the government of that unhappy prince.

Such expenses were, no doubt, extremely great. They were, however, not so very different from what are called the ordinary expense of war, of the maintenance of the garrison and of the army. They are not

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 369

always very apt to consider what it will cost them in the price of the commodity. The tax which the king of Prussia imposes upon bread is a proof that the state has no care about what it will sell at. The same tax, imposed upon wine, though not so strictly, and though it is a much more pernicious tax than any upon bread, yet is a proof that the state has not the same regard for the prices of commodities, which it does for those of other sorts. The tax upon wine is supposed to amount at present to about ten per cent. The price of a gallon or so of good French brandy may be supposed to amount at present to L3, and that of a gallon or so of good British wine, to L4. If you add to the price of the latter, therefore, ten per cents more than the tax which pays for the administration of the law which imposes the tax; you must add likewise ten cents to its actual price, or to its nominal value, in order to account, as nearly as possible, for this additional ten cents. If, instead, you took out of this tax a tenth of the money which is paid for the consumption, or a fifth of that for the rent of the wine-cellars; you would not, in the price of the commodity, be able, with the greatest precision to account, with the least accuracy for the whole of this additional five or six per cents; because you would still have to take out of it a tenth, or a fifth part of that money which pays for that consumption; and the whole of this would be paid away, as in the foregoing instance, into the price, and not into its real cause, the consumption, nor into its real productive powers. The price of wine, therefore, though it might be taxed exactly as high as it could be, and though it might pay exactly as much for every additional ten cent., would never repay, even upon that account, that tenth or fifth part of its price which was over and above paying for those ten cents, which were in reality over and beyond compensating the whole tax, and paying away, as it were, the greater portion of the money which paid that tax. It is the interest of the state only that its subjects should pay for its wines at the price at which they are paid; and the tax, instead of raising their price in proportion as it ought to raise theirs in consequence of the tax, necessarily

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 370

sinks it, and thereby hurts the revenue which ought to go to the sovereign, instead, perhaps, both of him and the subject taxed.
The tax of customs is levied by means of agents who go about everywhere among the people, inquiring of them, first, the value, and, if possible the kind and quantity, of all their goods imported and exported, and afterwards, what is the average value or quantity; the latter inquiry, however being frequently impossible. In order to know this average, they must, upon many occasions, go beyond the number of people whom it would otherwise concern, and they are liable to be detected, and punished for this. If the duties upon foreign wines were, in the same manner, imposed by collectors who went about everywhere among their fellow-subjects, the wine-grower, if he was suspected of smuggling, would not have long life to enjoy, and would be soon after exposed to all the horrors of a legal process of examination and conviction.

Taxation is sometimes carried on with a view, not so much to enrich the people at large, as to oppress the rich. The great revenue, which, according to a certain account given by the late Dr Davenport (a very learned author, and a man very well acquainted with both history and law) is annually drawn from all duties of this kind upon the necessaries and comforts, is, in most countries of Europe, laid out, not in purchasing, or purchasing with a profit, the produce of their industry, or in employing it in the manner in which that produce is likely either to increase or to continue to increase; but in maintaining an army of menial slaves. In France, the greater part of this revenue is spent in the maintenance of those slaves, and it is not by augmenting, but in diminishing the produce of their labour that any considerable augmentation can be expected.

In England, the greater part of that revenue is not laid down in the purchase of the produce, or even in that of the labour of our fellow-subjects; it consists, instead, in a small tax of two and a-halfpences in twenty-penny pieces upon all wines, beer, ale and spiritous liquor, exported from England. This small duty, imposed in the same manner as all others of the kind, falls altogether, or very nearly, on the head of every private family; that of Mr Locke upon his servants and laboures

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 371

. But the greater the revenue, or, what comes to a much greater thing, what is commonly the price paid by the consumers, the smaller must necessarily be the revenue which the sovereign derives from it; for if the revenue of the people were equal, the greater part would naturally go to the support of government; and as they are not, it must always fall upon some particular order or class, of whom the sovereign himself must be the greatest.

The principal duties, either imposed at a particular time, or imposed in a particular manner, fall, first upon the persons, secondly, upon the goods imported or exported, and, lastly, upon the revenue which the persons, the goods, or both together make in the state.

Taxation, as it necessarily reduces revenue, so it necessarily increases expense; for though the person subject to it may derive some advantage from the tax, it must always be the poorer he that suffers by the expense which it occasions of his subsistence.

The duties of excise and customs, besides, are not imposed for the purpose of making any profit, or even of reducing any other revenue of the society, but for the purpose of promoting the public interest, and of relieving the people from some burden which they may think proper to lay upon their respective sovereigns. The excise upon malt and malt liquors raises, the one a tax, and the other an expense, which is finally paid by the consumers, and is, in reality, no burden upon them. The customs upon foreign and inland commodities, on the contrary, fall almost entirely upon the revenue which is derived either from the wages of the workmen, or from the profits of the merchants that deal with them. They are both finally, too, ultimately drawn back upon this latter revenue; and the final payment is always made to them in money, which is ultimately returned upon their profits in the shape either either either of rent or interest. The final payment, therefore, of the customs falls upon the revenue which is derived from those wages, profits and rents. It is the final payment of the excise, indeed, which, as it necessarily reduces the price of the goods, occasions a certain proportion, perhaps, in their sale, and thereby gives some encouragement to the growers. But the price of the commodities is reduced only in consequence of this encouragement; it does not reduce them in their nature. The excise, indeed, and in general all the duties of excise which affect the revenue

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 372

of individuals, fall almost entirely, or very nearly equally upon those of the different inhabitants, who are obliged either to furnish their goods for paying the tax (by sending it by another channel), to whom, therefore, it belongs to pay that duty; and to those merchants and other traders, who are enabled by this advantage to undersell, and even to absorb, all those of the country.

The ton of malt taxed at 4d., containing 48 gallons, contains about the quantity of liquor contained in two bushels of the best wheat, at 4s. 4½ d., and is, accordingly taxed at four-and-twenty shillings. But a bushel of wheat, when imported, as at present, at 4d., costs but about 3½d.; a gallon of malt at 4s. 4½ d., and a bushell of barley, which costs only about 4s. 4d., will, before it goes to the malt-house be exchanged for but 4½s., or about L.3 : 6 : 8½. The whole quantity, therefore, of this tax, which falls, it seems, almost altogether upon that part of the revenue which belongs either directly to the consumers, the landlords of the lands, and the cultivators, the great body of the inhabitants of Scotland, will not be equal to what they could afford, had they not this advantage over those who are not so favoured. The greater the proportion of this tax, therefore, which falls upon those two classes of people, the more it will necessarily fall upon them all together. The same proportion of the excise upon spirit, which at present, as we learn from Mr Hume's History, falls altogether, or nearly altogether upon those of those other two classes, will, in the same manner, in Scotland, probably, in a much greater proportion fall upon them both. It is not impossible that this proportion may be still higher, or that the spirit of Scotland may contribute a greater revenue than it does at the moment, though, from the small quantity of its excise, the proportion is probably still too small for this.


 PART III.


Of the Expense of maintaining the Army.
The Expense of maintaining the Army.

In the maintenance of the Army the principal part  of this expense consists.

In time of war it consists in the salaries, pensions, equipage and maintenance, both of the active and of the reserve

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 373

forces; in what may properly be said to constitute, in modern parlance, the national treasure, or, in military language, the stock reserved for immediate consumption. The expense of the war must, in this case, be laid out upon this stock.

The expense of the peace, too (which is commonly spent in maintaining an army and a navy, though in modern war it seldom has been otherwise employed), may be considered as the ordinary or necessary expenses of government. In peace it consists chiefly in what may be called public buildings, public roads and bridges, and public garages and warehouses; the wages and maintenance of the servants and dependents of the public offices. The revenue of the sovereign, or, in modern military language, that part of his capital which remains after defraying the expense, not only of the active and reserve forces, of which the employment during a peace is necessarily divided between two distinct bodies, the army and the navy, but of the civil and military establishments, is altogether independent of the war, or even the peace establishment of his country, or even of that part of it to be employed in the immediate defence of that country, which is not at peace. The revenue, on this account, is not subject to the alteration either of war or peace. The sovereign, like any other owner of a capital stock, is perfectly secure that its value shall be no where altered by the fluctuations of its price, by the fall in its real value occasioning the loss, and the rise in the value resulting from the renewal of war, or the extension of peace. But though the sovereign is perfectly secure in the possession of his public stocks, yet he must be more so in the disposal of them, and in their being applied to those purposes for which they are most likely to be of service; to maintain, fortifie and defend the state, or the country to which he belongs. The expense, therefore, of maintaining the peace, must always bear some proportion to the revenue of the sovereign.

In a commercial country, where the trade of all its inhabitants consists chiefly in carrying the produce either directly or indirectly to some other place, such as London or Amsterdam, the whole annual produce must necessarily belong to some one of the different consumers. The expense of maintaining, defending and supplying them, may, no doubt, in these cases, bear a very considerable proportion to that of the general revenue or expense of the state, or to what may properly,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 374

be called the defence and protection of the whole society; but it cannot bear the smallest. It can bear only a proportion to the expense which is necessary for procuring the necessary subsistence for its own maintenance. The subsistence of the whole society must always be sufficient to supply, not only this particular expense of each individual citizen or member of it, or even of the sovereign, or even of the whole state, but the expense of the society as a whole. The maintenance, protection and consumption of every individual, however great his revenue, are, no more than the subsistence and consumption of that of all the individuals of his society. The maintenance, protection and enjoyment of the whole society, however, must be sufficient both for supplying his revenue and that for supporting the defence of the society, or, what comes to the same thing in the end, for making war.

The customs, therefore, by diminishing, or, if I may be allowed such an expression, by checking altogether, the exportation of foreign goods, tend, it is probable, both directly and indirectly, to increase the quantity of subsistence which is annually imported into the country.


 PART IV: Of Taxes upon the Rent of Land, on the Expense of maintaining Land-Carriage, on the Expenses occasioned by the Commerce of Goods imported from distant countries, and of those exported to near ones, on those occasioned by Bridges, and on the Expense of repairing the Roads.

 Taxes upon the Rent and Profit of Lands, on the Expenses of the Land-Carriage and of those who maintain Land-Carriages, upon the Expense of Bridges and other public Roads, are all proper subjects of taxation. The rent of land is the only rent which is paid to the landlord for the use of his estate. He gets the benefit of it, and nobody gets it for him, except, perhaps, the person who lets him out to farm it. The rent and profits of land are in every respect regulated according to the interest or probability of their yielding a rent; that is, according to their being employed or not in maintaining the farmer. The rent and profit of all other lands may be so regulated, and ought to be so regulated, according to what is either the greater or less degree of the certainty or uncertainty of their being able to yield any such rent or profit, according as either the rent is higher or lower in money terms, or according as it is nearer or remotest

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 375

.

The profits of the undertaker or employer, of any particular work of art, or manufacture, may likewise be so regulated. If it requires more skill and knowledge than ordinary labour, it may be paid higher. But if it is of so simple and elementary nature, that any person with ordinary skill and knowledge can execute it, it may be taxed at so low a rate as may insure the workmen against the negligence and bad conduct, not only of their employers but of every other person. It seems impossible, therefore, that the profits, both ordinary and high, should ever be so much above their natural level in any country, as they are commonly in France and Holland. The high profits of trading companies are, no doubt very different from these general principles; and it is not by any means certain that those particular trading companies are always more advantageous than the general stock of trade.
4. Taxes on the Rent or Profit of Land, and of the Stock which Manures or Cultivates the Land. Taxes upon the rents and profit of land are imposed in many different countries. In England the most important is the land tax, which, in the present times (1772), is supposed to amount, at an average, to one half per c. The other taxes, which sometimes fall unequally, either upon land rent itself, upon that portion of profit which is paid for the improvement and use of land; or upon some other part of the produce, of land, the rent and profit of buildings and of the instruments of trade, are, I believe, all equally or more improperly assessed, according to some of those general principles above mentioned. In France the most important tax upon this sort of produce, the rent of houses, is called les recompenses, and is computed at two-thirds per cent. and in Germany at one third, or one-fifth, of all that is paid in land rents.[74] In all these countries taxes are sometimes imposed, which, though not always equal in their amount or in their nature (and the same thing might perhaps be true of some of them, too), yet all tend to the same thing; the reduction of the rent and profit of all sorts of land.
3. Rent. The rent of land may, in some countries, either consist altogether in its own natural price, the lowest rent to be got by cultivation; or in a certain portion of the produce, which, being over and above what is sufficient

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 376

to pay the rent itself, is commonly advanced as profit to the farmer. In the former case, there can seldom be any monopoly of the market, and consequently no occasion for the raising the rate of profit higher in proportion to the quantity of labour which it is necessary to employ in bringing the crop to market; and the price of corn must necessarily rise with the rent. The price of barley is said to have done so in Scotland in 1745, when the tax upon it was reduced from sixpence to fivepence a bushel; that of oats from threepence to threepence, in 1746. The proportion between the natural price of the two sorts of grain is very different, as well as very different according  To the extent of their natural price the rent of a landlord is everywhere very different; in Scotland it amounts only to about six shillings the acre. But the produce of a small piece, of a mile square or of an inch in extent, will always contain a much greater quantity than six shillINGS, the whole value of the tax upon barley at present. If, in order, therefore (I suppose) that he can sell his piece of ground, the landlord ought to pay only six shillings the acre for the rent, it must be clear that he cannot afford the whole rent, and that, consequently, he cannot raise it any further. If the tax upon barley, therefore, was raised from sixpence to seven shillings the bushe; that on oatmeal, from three pence to three pence; that on all sorts, from fourpence to fivepence; the landlord might still find that, in order to bring his crop to market, it would not be necessary for him either to raise the rent, nor even the price of the grain, much higher in proportion than it is now, in order to afford a moderate rent and reasonable profit, though it were indeed so. The proportion between the natural price and the market price of corn, it is true (for it is impossible, perhaps, to reduce it below what is just sufficient to compensate, both the natural and the market price), is much less in England, than in Scotland, or even in France, the three countries most remote from each others, though, from the same causes, perhaps more so, in point of fertility, than either. But in those three provinces the proportion is very different. In the greater part of England it is

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 377

now more usual, indeed, for the malt to be distilled in the still-house, than for the beer and malt liquors to come into competition in the market; but this practice is still not very common. In Scotland, the malt is sometimes still distilled before being put into casks; but the casks are never afterwards emptied of the fermented liquor, but immediately filled with fresh water; which, by the way, is always much cheaper than the malt liquor. The beer and malt liquors are, in this case, both mixed with the fermented liquor, and, consequently, are mixed together with it, and sold at a double price.

The Scotch system of taxation, besides, though not so severe as that of the English government, is, perhaps in proportion to the greatness of its revenue, equally arbitrary and uncertain. In Scotland, the malt tax of twentypence in the hundred weight is levied at the same time as the other duties, at sixpences in the hundred weight; and though it seems scarce ever either collected or applied to any purpose, yet the uncertainty of collection renders it, perhaps, more perncious and oppressive. In England, where the duties are all assessed and collected with much more exactness, the uncertainty of assessment renders it much less pernicient and oppressive.

In Scotland, the distillery trade is carried on with the aid, it has been said, not of a particular town, province, or district of country towns; but with the aid, perhaps, of the principal burghers of every such district. In England, on the contrary, where the excise is imposed at the same rate, or very near of the rate of sixpences, every different district, or every different county within each great kingdom, is supposed to have an exclusive trade to the malt liquor of its respective distillery; a circumstance, perhaps of very ancient origin.

It has been said, too, that, in consequence of the prohibition of the importation of foreign beer, the trade in the greater part of Scotch bottlers and carriers has become entirely foreign, or at least has ceased to be of any importance in the country where it used to be. I cannot believe that this can ever be the case. The trade in the greater part of Scotch carriers and bottlers, as it was before the late repeal, is certainly not less foreign, or less of importance, after that act, than it ever was before. If the trade

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 378

which is carried on in this manner, is carried upon within the territory, or carried on between the different provinces of the same country, and the duties which it imposes are all laid and levied at the same time, they will, without any variation of rate, be paid equally by every different producer of sugar, rum, tobacco or other goods which can come into competition with it.

The sugar, malt, and hops of Great- Britain, being the produce of British industry and commerce, are all of them, in this manner, subjected to a duty, which is finally paid by their respective producers; and though they are all, or nearly all, of them imported, yet, by means either (1) of bountIES upon exportation; or (2) of the exemption from all customs duties, which are granted to such articles of the produce of Great Britain as come from foreign countries free of all duties; the consumer is not necessarily deprived either of the benefit or of the duty of which he is the producer.

The malt, which is the produce of British industry and commerce, is subjected, in like manner, both to an importation duty of fivepence in weight, which may be taken off in any quantity upon payment of the duty; and, if it comes into competition with foreign beer and ale, to a similar duty of one penny. If it comes into any competition with foreign wines, it is liable, in the same manner, to a like importation duty of two pences the hundredweight. The brewer and the retailer are the only persons, in Great- Britain, whose revenue or profit, by means either (1) of bounties upon the exportation of such commodities as may fall within the general description, or (2) of the exemption of such commodities, from all duties of customs, are either diminished, augmented, taken off altogether, or made a good deal more difficult.

The sugars and malt, of which such commodities are the produce of foreign, are, like the foreign wines which come into competition with the wine of France and Holland; subjected, too (in the same manner) to an importation tax, which, if it falls upon their exaltation in any particular market, is finally paid, not by their producer, but, by the consumers, who pay it by their purchases. If the duties of excise upon malt, hops and sugars are taken away; and, in the same manner, if bounties

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 379

are given upon the exportation of such foreign goods as are fit for immediate use and application, it is evident, that a much greater quantity will immediately be sent out of the country than could ever have gone into it. The bounty, it is true (and this may be regarded, without offence to those who have given such bounties), is given for the encouragement, rather than for the sale, of the goods exported; and it is not the interest of the dealers, who are generally the principal consumers, but that of the public which is served, not by the dealers only, but by all the other dealers who deal in the commodities subject either to a duty or a bounty, and who thus contribute towards raising the price. But the bounty upon malt, hops and sugar raises not only that price, but that rent of malt which is necessary for supporting the culture, the raising of the goods and their preparation, the employment of all those who labour about them; the farmers, manufacturers, and merchants who supply them, and all those who buy and sell in the neighbourhood, together, contributing to the raising of the rent, too. The whole body, therefore (and the greater part of the smaller part), of all those who are either directly or indirectly interested in the raising of the rent, is thereby benefited by such a regulation of trade as this. The merchants and manufacturers of the country, besides, whose trade is thus encouraged by this regulation of the trade of the merchants and manufactures, will, in the long-term, receive an equal or superior value for the commodities which they sell; because the goods which they buy with their own surplus produce, being thereby raised to a higher price than before (by the increase of the duty on malt), will purchase an additional quantity, or, in the words of Mr Hume (though I do not pretend that I have got his exact words), an additional equivalent, of the goods of the merchants and manufacturers of the country. The merchant who buys of the brewer, the manufacturer who purchases of that farmer, the merchant who sells to the retailer, and all those whose trade is thus promoted by this increase of price, receive an equivalent which they had before, and a value which they have now, for no other purpose, but the sake of the improvement of that commodity.

It has been thought by some writers, however (I believe by Mr. Montesquié), and by some Scotch writers more particularly (Mr. Law and Dr.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 380

Burn), too heavy a tax upon such commodities to be imposed upon them without any real encouragement from the state; but this, they pretend, is exactly the effect which they had in view. They were, therefore (according to these writers, at least) willing that it should not be levied with so moderate a revenue as to leave so great an accumulation of revenue to be drawn back by the state upon exigency; but that it should be so heavy a tax, in order that it might leave so great an accumulation to fall into the keeping of the state as was necessary for its defence and support. This opinion, however, seems to have been founded altogether in fancy; because, if the state was to have a revenue sufficient both to maintain its own peace establishment and its foreign wars (which, by the same reasoning it could not do, even with the greatest liberally applied), there could be no necessity that it should have an accumulation either of revenue or treasure beyond what was necessary to maintain those two different institutions.

The revenue and expense, therefore, necessary to support the different establishments of the different states, are not equal in all of them. In the ancient state of Greece and Rome, they seem, indeed, very much greater; and, according to some authors (Plutarch especially), the expense, instead, of being deflected towards the maintenance of the public works, was directed to defray the private vanity of some particular families. But, though in those ancient republics there was not the same inequality of fortune as in our present monarchical governments; yet, in the expense both  of the state and of the individuals composing it, there seems to have been a great inequality.

The ancient sovereigns, like the present kings of Great Britain, seem frequently to have had no other revenue but what was derived from their own personal merit; and, in the maintenance of their different establishments (for they were, in all probability, not always equally well maintained by each one), they were obliged to make every effort that they could to defray, as well as they could, their own private vanity and extravagances. The ancient republics were, in general, less wealthy than our modern monarchies; and in proportion to the extent and wealth of each country, the expense of the state seems, during the greater portion of their continuances, much greater, both in quantity, and in quality. The Roman emperors seem to be supposed, in all accounts, to

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 381

be particularly responsible for the great extension of manufactures in Italy. In what was called the Ostia colony, a considerable town in what is now Tuscia, they established the famous port of Agrum; which afterwards became a centre of the commerce of the greater part, if not the greater part, both, of Italy and the neighbouring provinces. They gave the name, too, of AGRUM, to a town in Spain which was originally inhabited by barbarous shepherds. It was there, too, that, towards the close of the fourth and beginning of the fifth centuries, we find a considerable colony erected of such rude and uncultivated woods as nature had not yet reduced to a state of cultivation. This town was afterwards called Aricia. It was during the continuance either of these colonies or those woods, that the manufactures and the commerce of the country gradually grew up, till at length they were so much advanced, that they were able to support, and even, in many places, to overawe and overawl the government of the republic. In the course, however, of the four centuries before the Christian, or even of the two hundred and forty years preceding the fall of the Roman empire, the manufactures and commerce of Italy were, no doubt, in many places much more extensive than they had been in the course of the four centuries preceding that event. In every city, and even in the remotest country villages, there was then, I believe, a great manufactORY, of some sort or other, employed in the preparation of some article of the rude produce of land, of which, after the manner of the times (for the manner of the times was very different from that of the present times), it was thought proper that the whole produce of such a town should go to the king as his rent; or, what came nearly about the same thing, as his profit.


 ART. II

Of the Expense of maintaining useful Institutions for the Education of the Youth, and of supporting those of Industry and Commerce.

It has already, I think, sufficiently been shown, that the expense which the sovereign can lay out upon his own person is necessarily limited by two circumstances, the want of it being always more or less compensated, first, in some measure, by that which he saves from other sources; and secondly, in some measure by that of the society at large, by the revenue which is drawn from its

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 382

taxes. The sovereign, indeed, is not only the source of the first, and, in some measure, the second circumstance, but of both the first and second; he is the source of the first only; and, in some respects, of the second. He can lay out upon himself no expense which the society can afford to pay, and he can lay it out, too, upon no other persons than such as can afford to pay for it themselves. The revenue laws which, in England and Holland, restrain almost entirely the interior trade to those two particular classes, the merchants, and the tradesmen, are altogether arbitrary and unnecessary restraints. The revenue laws, besides, of all other nations, which restrain the interior commerce of the great bodies of the people, even to those two particular classes, and even to such a small number of them, seem to have been altogether arbitrary and superfluous, and may perhaps have been altogether insufficient.
4th of William and Anne.

The 4th of William III., chap 26. provided it shall have been enacted before sun-rising, and no hereafter after, that every subject, within the kingdom of England and the dominions of the queen of France, and subject likewise to the payment thereof, may take out and possess at all times, without any warrant or permission of the said justices of peace, any goods or choses of goods, of whatever kind, which have been delivered to him by sea and by inland navigations, upon condition, that he will deliver them to the receiver of customs at the port where he takes out such goods; and, further, that the goods so taken out by such a person, when he returns again into the same port, should be paid to the receiver of the customs at that port, with such reasonable security as the said receivers may think proper; the said justices of peace, after consulting with their council, shall have power, upon their own authority and judgment, to grant a warrant, if they think it necessary, for the taking out of such goods by other persons, provided the receiver of the customs at that port, with the like reasonable security as he may have for taking them out, shall give notice thereof in writing, to the person to whom it is intended to give them; and if the receiver of customs at the port where the said person takes out such goods shall neglect to give notice, within five months after such notice, of the place of absconding

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 383

, to the receiver of the customs in such other place as the said receivers think proper; then, notwithstanding any such neglect of notice, and notwithstanding any other penalty or forfeiture which may have been incurred, every such receiver, after paying the duties to the queen, may bring an action in the court of chancery, to recover possession of the said goods; but if he recovers such goods by judgment in his own favour, he may, in default, and for such a time only as the said justices think proper, be proceeded against by the court in common law.

The tobacco and salt duties, imposed in 1766 by the 7th Geo. II. were, the first of those duties, extended to include the importations from the British plantations. This extension was afterwards continued and confirmed by the 9&#8260;2nd Geo.; and the 5th of William IV. chap 28. The other duties imposed by these two acts, the customs duty, and the importer and exporter's duty, were all, at one time, limited in their application to such British subjects only, and were not extended so far to include aliens; and the former part, therefore, of this chapter, concerning alien duties and duties upon importations from foreign countries, refers chiefly to British subjects.

The tobacco and salt duties imposed, the 1st of William IV. chap 27. and 29. by the 10th and 12th of Charles II. were likewise extended to cover the importation from all foreign countries.


 PART II.

Of duties payable on the Importation of Foreign Manufactures into this Kingdom, and upon their Exports from other Countries.

 The different duties, which are payable by every nation upon the importations, of the different sorts of foreign manufactures into any particular country, are, the one upon the whole importations; and the other upon the different branches of each sort which are brought within certain bounds, or upon those only which exceed those bounds. The duties of the former are commonly known under the names, duties upon importations of the different sorts of raw hides, skins of different kinds; the duties of those of manufactures which have been improved by art or manufacture, are called the duties upon manufactures.

The duties upon the importation of the materials and manufactures of the colonies, which are made use of in the manufacture of other countries, are called the bountIES upon particular manufactures.


 Part III.

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 384

The Expenses of Government.The expense, both of preparing and paying the taxes, of collecting the revenue, and of disburden ing the subjects of the society; will naturally be divided among different departments of government, according as those different departments are either intended or necessary to support that particular department.

The expense of preparation is commonly defrayed by a small number of officers, whose salaries are paid from the revenue of the sovereign. This small number of men, therefore, may very well be considered, as an expense of preparation, properly belonging, not to one single department, or to one single function, of government, but to all the different functions of the same department. The officers who execute and maintain this expensive preparation, must, in the same manner, contribute to support that other, or, what is nearly equivalent to that same purpose; the support, not of a particular function, but that of the whole civil administration. The expenses of disbursement belong to another set, of men whose wages and subsistence are drawn from a revenue, derived from the people. The officers of the public funds may, no more than those of preparation, be considered as an expenses of disburden ing the subject of government, and may be regarded as a sort of public trustees, who have been entrusted with a trust for which it was expected they should provide. Their expenses necessarily arise from two sources; their salaries, which arise partly from this trust and from their commission; and their commission, which arises, not so much from their salary as, from their being the instruments of executing the trust entrusted to them by their superiors. Those expenses are finally discharged, either by a discharge from the debt contracted by their masters in executing their trust, and by the annuity or interest of the annuity which is finally paid from this discharge; by the discharge of the debt of their sovereign, and, in most cases, even by that annuity.
10The Expense of the Public Funds.

In the execution of their several duties and trusts vested in the different civil and military establishments, the greater part of the officers and servants of every state, it is evident, must contribute to support the general authority and the general power, either of that state or of some of the subordinate states which are subject either to the dominion, or, in the greater part, to that government which exercises the dominion over that state, or, what is almost the identical term,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 385

which maintains and employs that government.
The revenue which they annually expend in this manner, must, no doubt be very considerable. The sovereign himself is, perhaps the greatest spendthrifter of them all. In the expense, too, of defending the country from foreign invasion, he not only employs the whole strength and power, but his own, and, what is perhaps of still greater consequence to him than his own, the revenue and expense of the whole society of his subjects.
The revenue which the greater parts of those who exercise the civil, or those who exercise the military jurisdiction, annually expend upon those different occasions, is certainly very considerable, and must necessarily be sufficient to maintain, first, the necessary expenses of their own respective establishments; and secondly, the necessary expense of those which are under their immediate command. The expense, however (for I have not yet had time to examine more carefully the expense of those establishments), of the whole society must, in all great states, be much greater than the whole expense of their own particular establishment, of which the greater part must be employed in maintaining, first the soldiers, who execute their commands; and afterwards, the officers and servants, whom those soldiers obey, and whose expense is, therefore necessarily defraying their expense, must always be much greater than their soldiers. In all great states the whole of this second expense, besides, must necessarily be defraysed by some other source of revenue, of which the expense, too, is necessarily greater than the expense of maintaining, either those soldiers, the officers and servants of those soldiers, the whole society which is under their command; or by the whole revenue and wealth, either of the state, or, if you will, of that great body which is subject to its dominion.
The revenue of the great body of the people is, in every country, a fund destined for maintaining, not only those particular persons who happen to be in the public service, and who are, in reality and appearance, the only persons whom it is ever intended to support; and for maintaining the officers and soldiers who execute their orders; but for supporting the whole civil establishment, of which the maintenance, either of these two classes, or of the greater part either, may sometimes, perhaps, be considered as necessary, though perhaps, in most countries, not always. The expense of the greater parts of this civil and military establishments, however (for I have now had time to examine more carefully both the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 386

revenue and expenditure, than I had done before), it will readily enough be allowed (and I have already given some reason to suspect it of being somewhat over-rated), is very considerable. The whole, therefore (I mean the revenue and expense of all those different establishments), it must be said, is much greater in proportion to that of any particular one, than the whole revenue and expense of any single merchant or manufacturer, would be to his, had he no other establishment. But the revenue, or the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, the real revenue of every society or order, which is the fund which maintains and employs the great body of the people, is much greater than the revenue, or even that of any single person. The revenue, too, of the sovereign, or the rent of his dominions and of all those which lie under his protection; is much greater. It does not, indeed, consist, like the revenue of merchants and manufacturers (who, in proportion to the whole revenue and produce of the country, contribute a very small part to its support), either in the neat produce of their own lands, in what they themselves produce or purchase; or, what, perhaps, they really purchase or reproduce, though it sometimes happens, in such circumstances, that their neat produce bears some resemblance to that reproduction. The revenue of a sovereign consists altogether, both of his revenue, and of his power of disposing of and commanding the great bodies of the people; of the one, as well as, I believe, the greater portion of the latter, and, therefore, in what is called his military and civil establishment. It is, besides all this, the fund, which, by taxing the great body of the people, maintains and employs the police of the society; and it is the fund, too, upon which all those different establishments depend for their revenue, their maintenance and employment. It must be remembered, too, that though the whole expense of a great kingdom may not always be defrayed from one single source; that, in reality the great revenue of the whole kingdom is commonly drawn from a very few sources only; from a great revenue, or from the neat revenue of all those who are subject to taxation. In Great England the greater part, perhaps the greater part, 

 CHAP. IV.

OF THE EXPENSE, OR OF THE RENT OF A NATIONAL LIBRARY, OR OF THOSE BOOK

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 387

S WHICH CAN MAKE UP THE EXPENSE, OR THE PRICE OF WHICH THE LAND IS PAID UP. The capital, too, of merchants is increased by the quick return, by the easy payment of their bills of exchanges, by what they save in keeping up warehouses, in buying and hiring carriages, in paying their clerks, and other servants, and in all other such expenses which are not peculiarly necessary to the trade of the particular merchant who deals with them. It is the same with that of the undertaker or owner of any public work. He advances, either the capital of the society which employs him or that of some particular persons who have lent him their money; and the interest which he gets from this advance enables him to carry on the work, and to repay the loan.

In a commercial state, the greater part of the capital of every different order of men, whether farmers, merchants, artificers, manufacturers, or even those whose profession it consists altogether, consists in money. Money is a part of the stock of all the different order, which, as soon as they can all combine in order to purchase or to pay for a stock of goods, is divided among them in the way in which the most advantageous for all the different parties concerned is that which gives them the greatest advantage in the competition of their own purchases and purchases. In a country where all trades are free, every farmer can employ his whole stock in the cultivation of land. In a country where the freedom of commerce renders it possible for all the different orders of merchants to trade in their turn, every artificer can employ all the stock which he has of any sort or kind which he has occasion to keep by him, and can divide this stock among the dealers whom he trusts, in the same manner, and according to the same principles as the rest. The greater part of manufacturers, and of the greater part of the retailers, have their stock of materials stored away, which can be employed, if they think proper to employ it. If the dealers who employ them should think proper to employ it, they will find them, and can afford to pay them, for their employment, the price of the materials. If the manufacturers and merchants should think proper to sell their goods at any price, the consumers will be obliged, in order that they may get what they pay, to pay for them the whole value of what they purchase with their money. But if, instead of being sold

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 388

, they were to be kept for future consumption, the whole capital which was employed in purchasing and producing them, would necessarily be turned into the stock of an annuity-holder, and the annuity-holder into a debtor to the company. It would be the same capital with which, in a few short years, it had maintained, and was still maintaining, the workmen who had produced those commodities; and though it might have continued, too, the productive labour 


 

 But though it was thus, as in a circle, continually winding and winding, in the course of many centuries, turned into a fund for paying off the debt of the society, it was not in this case necessarily turned into the productive fund, and put into motion a new quantity of productive labour; for the annual amount of the annuity-debts, which, in a long course, were paid off by it, would not necessarily increase, in any sensible proportion, the quantity of productive labour in that country. It might continue to maintain the same number, or very nearly the number, either immediately, or after many centuries, of industrious people. But though, in this manner, a considerable portion, perhaps, of the accumulated stock of a great society, was frequently annually wasted and consumed in the rude produce, without producing any new quantity of any sort; yet the annual produce of that stock would always have been greater than what had been employed in purchasing, producing, and maintaining it; because, in the first place (and in all cases where the expense of a society exceeds its revenue), the annual produce must be greater than the whole annual expense of that particular society.

In a country which has acquired, or is about to acquire riches, a considerable portion, perhaps, of the accumulated stock of any society, may sometimes, even in this manner be turned, and, without any other effectual expedient, probably will continue to be turned, into the productive fund; but which has not acquired those splendid and splendid profits, it is very probable, will not be able, for many centuries together, to purchase or produce the commodities which it purchases with the accumulated savings of that stock. In such countries, therefore, the annual consumption of the stock is likely to be still more or less greater than the annual production of that stock.

In a poor, unproductive country such a portion may frequently, even in the course of many centuries, be turned, without any effect

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 389

uating law, into the pockets, either of the rich or of the poor. In a rich, fertile, productive, and industrious one, it may continue for many centuries in the same hands. It seems to depend altogether, therefore, on the circumstances of that country.

In Great Britain the sinking funds are, upon most occasions, employed to relieve the public exigency. The present exigencies of our North American and West Indian colonies, however, may render it necessary to change this usage; and it may, therefore, be well worth while, even in these, that the parliament should examine very closely, both what are, and what are not the proper objects of the different funds which it has in this respect assumed to itself. In order to determine what are, or are not proper objects, we must consider not merely what are likely, but what actually is, the state of the society at large.

In Great Britain there is a general fund of revenue destined for the payment of the public debt; of which, in times past, the repayment has been deferred in consequence of occasional and temporary surmountings of the exigencies arising from the great expense, both at home, and upon distant voyages; and which, in the course of these different surmounts, has accumulated, in a great sum, a considerable sum, equal to what had always been expected, and, in the opinion, was, upon all ordinary accounts sufficient for carrying on the whole business, and repaying the debt contracted. The interest, too, of this sum is, in the present state of the country (which is not very dissimilar, in its internal economy from the present state in Holland), paid by the subscribers to the different annuITIES for lives. These annuity sums, too (the greater part, I imagine, of which are paid by means either, of the sinking fund, the old North America fund), are all, upon most occasions (and particularly upon those arising out of extraordinary expenses) applied to the repayment, with an additional interest of a much higher rate, the repayment, indeed of a much smaller sum than the principal, which had always before been advanced to them, but of which the repayments have been delayed till the greater part of the funds which compose the old North America and the British West India funds were fully applied. The whole of the present annual produce of the land and labour of Great Britain is, it is acknowledged by all men

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 390

of good sense and observation (I do not mean by this to imply by this expression any suspicion of falsehood), sufficient to maintain and provide for, not only all the people of Great Britain, but for every man of twenty or thirty years of age, and of all ranks in society, and consequently for all the inhabitants of a great kingdom of more than twenty millions, and of more equal extent, than the British monarchy, though, perhaps, it had never had so large a revenue, had never possessed such extensive territory, had never been able to maintain so great an empire, and was, therefore not always, as at present in the best state of the country, so perfectly secure against foreign invasion.
The revenue of all these different orders of people being equal, their consumption must be equal; their revenue being equal, their consumption may very properly be supposed the same.

The revenue and consumption, however, are not necessarily equal, in every particular period of society, nor in all periods. The revenue and consumption, it must be remembered, vary in every period of society from what they were during the first establishment of the feudal law, to that of the invention of the mechanical system. They have been continually changing during all those periods, and are, therefore necessarily variable. But though the revenue of every period varies from year 



¾


The revenue of all periods varies from year to years; from one century to another; from one period of history, to another. It has been very properly remarked, by the very intelligent author of the Tracts upon the Political Economy of the Farmers' Company, the greater the variation in any one year's produce, in proportion to its quantity, the more likely is it that the whole annual production will, in the course of the next twelve or fourteen years, fall into the lowest rate of profit which can well happen to take place in that produce. This is a conclusion which, I apprehend, admits not only of some probability but of some truth. It is founded altogether upon a comparison between the actual profits, in any two different periods, of different kinds of industry; and, as such, cannot be disproved, but may be accepted as a certain and indisputable truth, I believe; but it is a truth, too, which admits of no absolute refutation.
The revenue of every period of history is necessarily regulated by two different circumstances. First; by the annual produce, or, what comes

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 391

to the like thing, the price of that produce, they are obliged, one with another, either to maintain a greater number, or to furnish an equal quantity of food for a larger number; and the one cannot be maintained, the other fed, without a greater quantity of food. Secondly, the tax which they pay upon every such produce is a real command of their labour; and it necessarily obliges them both, to provide always, more or less, that quantity of food which it is intended they shall provide. Thirdly, by the annual produce, or, what comes to like things, the price of that produce, they pay a rent or a duty to the proprietors of land, of the produce which is thus taxed. The rent or duty is in proportion to the value which it adds to that produce, and is regulated according to a like valuation. Fourth, by this tax or command of their own labour, they are both enabled to maintain a greater number of productive labourers, who work in the year, and to furnish an equal quantity, at the same time, with food, clothing, and lodging, for an equally great multitude of unproductive labourers. They have a command of their own labour which they can maintain and employ, and which they are not altogether at liberty to neglect or reject; and this command is of the greatest importance, both in the short-run, and in the long-run, of all their projects.
The parsimonious, the frugal statesmen, who, in times of peace and plenty, attempt to direct the conduct and government

¼


The parsimonuous, or the frugal statesmen who, in the midst  Of a great war and national distress endeavour, either to restrain, or to direct the industry and industry of private men in order to maintain the state; such as those who planned, with Machiavel and Colbert, the economical plan which afterwards brought about the pacification of France, and which was executed with such great success, seem, upon first view, almost to be the enemies of war. Their object seems always to be, not to enable the people, but rather to degrade, the industry and industry of private men, and to turn their whole attention towards the maintenance and employment of the state.
3. Taxes, when imposed for public utility only, may sometimes be advantageous. When they affect the interest of the rich,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 392

they always hurt that of the poor; and the poor always suffer most when the interest of those whom they have trusted is sacrificed to the interests either either of the rich, or of some other rich man. The taxes which have been imposed upon the greater part of the taxes upon goods exported, and upon the greater part of the duties upon foreign goods, have both tended, in many cases, to lower the price of foreign goods, to reduce, in all the different branches of foreign commerce, the revenue and profit of all the different merchants, and, consequently to reduce the real wealth of every nation; to reduce it below what they had been accustomed to think it to be.
The misfortunes, however, which, from 1755 to 1763, befell Great Britain, were not altogether owing to any of the foregoing circumstances, but to one or two of those other.
The tax upon tea, which began to be imposed upon it in the year following the Revolution, was probably the principal of those which occasioned the late disorders. It seems, at first, not only reasonable, but unavoidable. It is the only duty upon tea that has ever, upon any occasion, been imposed without any provocation, and which has, upon every occasion been fully and completely complied with; and the tea-planters themselves are said not only to have paid it in good season, but in great quantities. It was, therefore a most convenient tax, as it reduced, in one single tax, almost all of the duties and prohibitions which had been imposed upon it, without either raising or reducing the price of tea. But when the tea-tax, as it was gradually extended to almost every other article, was found by experience to be so much above what could be levied at that particular moment, the scheme of taxing it in all at once was found to be as impracticable, as imprudent, and as ruinous as it could well be. It had been proposed to tax it at five shilling a-pound, and, notwithstanding a very high duty, it had been levied at three shillings. It was proposed, too, to raise it to ten shillings the quarter; and, notwithstanding a high duties, it had, at that time, been levied at six shillings. The scheme of taxing all at once the whole quantity, or, more properly, of taxing the different parts, of every particular article at the highest possible rate, is

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 393

not very likely to produce the intended effects. The people, instead of being obliged to contribute gradually to the discharge of the public debts, which would necessarily be accelerated by such an expedient, would, in a few short years be exposed to a new tax; and, instead either, of a gradual reduction in their taxes, of a progressive increase of their duties, of a more or less progressive rise of their rates, the whole body of their taxes would be thrown suddenly upon them, without any warning or opportunity for a voluntary contribution. In this case, too, the revenue which had been destined for defaying the public debt, might very easily be drawn from other funds, and employed to pay other expenses; and the whole burden of this extraordinary expense would be laid altogether upon one great fund, without any chance of relief, till some of its parts had, perhaps, become completely spent.
The operations, too, which have been carried on in order, not to raise money, but to balance the public accounts with foreign states, have generally proved more expensive and more troublesome than the original project.

When the public debts, which had been contracted for carrying on foreign wars, were finally paid, the surplus, which remained after paying all the expenses of the war, was, upon most governments, put under the management and protection of a public treasurer. This officer was charged with the execution of a certain proportion of the public debts contracted during the war, according as the terms of their ratification might happen to require. The profits which such an office afforded him upon his fees were, for a long time, considered by all nations as an eminence which no doubt was considerable, but which could never make him a very rich man, because he was always obliged, for his own security, to live in constant terror lest he should be accused, or be thought guilty of negligence or profusion in managing the public funds entrusted to his care.

In France, the finances of the kingdom have been for many ages in this situation. The king has always been the treasurer, and his revenue has been derived from the fees of his officers and dependents. The king, however (the French kings, as well as all other sovereigns), is not, in reality, the only rich man of the country; the other great body of the inhabitants are rich enough, but are, in reality poor dependent subjects; who, though they pay a small tax to the king, are obliged to contribute a great

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 394

one, to maintain, first the defence of the state against external enemies; and afterwards that of their own private persons, against their neighbours and dependants. In this situation it is natural, even for a rich man, to be very forward to employ whatever stock or treasure he has upon the first opportunity of being able to employ it, without waiting for the approbation or permission of any superior, but to go at once, with all his might and main, into a public workhouse, and there employ his industry to its utmost advantage. The great stock which is employed in the public service, is always more employed in supporting than in supporting private persons; in supporting the defence, and in supporting that of the society, than in supporting the interest either of private persons, or even of the great body of those who are not private, or but dependant upon private persons; in supporting the defence of their sovereign or commonwealth, than in supporting that of some private person or family, whose interest it may sometimes be to attack or destroy that defence, or to disturb the peace of their own.

It is not, however (for the sake either of the people or of the sovereign), necessary that any part, either of this stock should ever come into the possession of a particular individual; it can always, without any injustice, be distributed among a great many. It is necessary that it should come into the hands of a few only, that is, of those who can best use it; because, if there was any injustice in the distribution, it would soon be remedied. But the people and sovereign have generally the best of all interests, in proportion to their respective numbers. A very small number of people, however, can easily accumulate a considerable sum, and carry on a great deal of industry; provided they have a good management. The greater part, indeed, are not always able to do so. A great deal of stock must always reside in a small number, and the smaller number can always be disposed of more easily. But it can always be sold for more than it cost. A small stock, dispersed through all the different hands of the greater number, will everywhere be disposed to combine and combine together. The same small stock can everywhere be employed in a greater quantity, in supporting the industry and support of the society, in maintaining the great army and navy of the society; and can everywhere afford a better profit to the dealers.

In Great Britain, the annual

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 395

expense of the public debt is computed at about L.1,800 thousand; and this great debt has not been paid off, as in the other two countries. In 1747, the year in question, it amounted to about L3,000 thousand. The interest of this enormous debt was, before the late recoining, paid off with a small annuity of L500, the fifth part only of the money. The other three fourths of it was paid off with the first five pounds, and was, upon that account called the sinking fund, or what was then called L.2.8 million, which is equal, according to the present valuation, not to one-fifth part of what it was worth before the recoinding, nor to half the capital it contained before the late recoinding, but to about one-fifth of what was paid off with the fifth pound, or L1.5 millions. In consequence of the recoinding, this annuity has become, in every part, of greater value than the whole debt which it pays. The sinking fund of France, too, is said to amount to L3.6 million. In 1747, the whole public debts of the kingdom of France amounted to L.4,400,000,000. In the same year, there were, besides the public debts above mentioned, other public and private debtors which had accumulated into great debts, which the king, by a very expensive project of redressing them all, endeavoured to discharge by a new loan, of L.3.3 millions. This new debt was paid, with interest, by the sinking of the debt of the king.

In England, a new borrowing of the same kind is, I believe, altogether impossible. But the same spirit of parsimony, of saving at the expense of consumption, which would render such an operation impracticable, may render one more reasonable than it otherwise would be. It is in the nature of the system of funding to enjoin, as nearly as can conveniently be contrived, a balance between saving at the expense of consumption and borrowing at the expense of capital. The former must always be preferred to the latter. But the system, instead either, of forcing the balance so as to favour one of those two modes of funding, as that in which it prescribes a particular method for borrowing at the expense either of stock or of land, or both; or of prohibiting the

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 396

borrowing altogether; in favour of what is commonly called a perpetual fund, or of a perpetual annuity, the whole value of which can never be drawn back upon any exaction, whether of stock or of land; proposes a third, more moderate, but still a very strict system, of borrowing only upon the payment of an annual annuities, which are, in most cases (though not in all) payable out of the revenue, though they are sometimes granted as loans.

The Romans borrowed, it has been said by Mr Hume, from their public revenues, and in this case, as in the foregoing, they were not very frugally funded. The republic, however (according to this account, founded on the supposed maxims and principles laid down by Augustus), was at an end when this method of borrowing was adopted, though the Roman emperors continued to live for many ages. The republic was revived, and, during the minority, of the three last Roman emperors (from Hadrian to Dioclesian) the public revenues were all borrowed upon a perpetual fund. In the time preceding their elevation, the greater part of them had frequently been borrowed upon the payment of small loans. In those days, too (I believe, too), it was not considered very improper for a sovereign, in order to raise the funds of his treasury (for he had no other means of paying his debts, or of maintaining the troops that defended him), to lend a part of his own revenue in the same way as private persons do in the present times.


 CHAP II.

OF BORROWINGS FROM PRINCIPALITIES AND VARIOUS OTHER ACCOUNTS, IN ORDER TO FUND THE REPUBLIC.

 In order, therefore, either, to raise the capital of the state higher, or, in other words, in order to increase the annual produce of its industry, by a perpetual fund, or by some other permanent fund; or to augment the annual produce, or to increase the quantity of the annual produce of its industry; the state must, either, first, borrow from some one or other, or both of those different funds, and pay interest to that person, or people, for the use of his or their money; or it must raise money by borrowing from all those funds, and pay interest to all those who give money to it. In either event, the state must, either by raising its capital,

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 397

or, by some other expedient which can alone enable the sovereign to maintain a larger army and a greater navy than it can maintain at the present time; must either be obliged, in the maintenance of this larger capital, to pay an additional tax to the king, upon his stamp-duty upon all his different stamps, and, upon all his different orders of revenue, upon his annuity and land tax; in the maintenance, too, of this additional army, to pay an additional tax upon its officers, and, consequently, upon its arms, ammunition and stores; or, finally, it must be obliged either, first to reduce, in the whole extent of its revenue, its whole capital to what is necessary to maintain its present quantity of military force, in order to pay the additional tax which must necessarily be added upon that part of it which maintains that force, and, secondly to diminish, in the whole extent, its whole army and navy, so as, in the whole, to pay the additional tax which must likewise necessarily be added upon that part of it which maintains this greater quantity of force. In both events the state must be obliged, not to raise any more capital; but either to employ a part, or all, either of the annual produce of its lands and capital, or of the annual increase of the annual revenue which its industry annually produces; and the capital which employs the greater part, or all of either must, from the nature and purpose of things, necessarily have a larger value, and consequently be worth more than a smaller capital employed in maintaining it. The whole state must be reduced to one great source of revenue, the annual enhancement of the produce of its industry; or, if you will allow the expression, one great fund of revenue. The capital which maintains a larger military force must necessarily be worth more than a smaller one maintained in a like manner, in order to pay the additional taxes, and to augment the whole state of military strength.

It might, no doubt, be otherwise in some provinces. The capital, it may be supposed (and this, I believe it may be allowed, is by no means an absurd supposition), would be sufficient to maintain a greater army in those particular provinces, and to equip a greater naval force, if those provincial governments were obliged, in order to maintain their own revenue and military force, either, first to reduce their whole capital, and thereby reduce the whole value of their annual enhancement, to which they could

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 398

thus be entitled, and, second, to subject all other subjects to a like reduction, and consequently, to the like loss, or to some lesser gain; and, lastly, if they could subject all other subjects to a like reduction, but to such an extent only as that which they themselves were subject to; or, in other words, if their own revenue and military force, instead of being augmented by this new tax, were, on account of the loss of their own enhancement and the consequence of a lesser enhancement for other subjects (the same loss and lesser enhancement for the different provinces), reduced to what the whole state was then supposed to have been worth.
4th Period.Taxes upon Rent and Profit, in consequence either of Increase of Population, or of the Improvement of Land, in the Different Colonies, and in the British Provinced Colonies.

The fifth and last period, of which I shall have occasion to speak hereafter, consists in taxes, of this kind, which, in the progress of population, increase the revenue of all the other periods. Such taxes are imposed, not so much for any public good which the society may derive from the prosperity or decline of its inhabitants, or from the improvement or neglect of their land, but for the purpose either, first, of enabling the sovereign or commonalty of each particular province to maintain their civil and military establishment, in the same manner, or, second, in some cases of both of these. The rent and profits of all other lands may be taxed in the same way; and in the course of a century or two, perhaps, this species

The rent and profits, of all the land in a particular country, can be considered in two ways; either, first; or, secondly, in the proportion, both of their natural increase, and of what they are likely to increase naturally in the course of a century or more, in proportion to the whole annual produce of its agriculture and manufactures; or in the proportion, of their natural increase only; in other things being left entirely to the discretion, and sometimes even to the caprice of government, whether the rent of some lands should rise in a particular country, or sink in a neighbouring. The rent of land in Great England, and that in Holland, are both taxed according to the first method

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 399

. The land tax in Great Britain is levied by a land-tax assessment, or by a valuation at a particular price, which varies according to different factors of rent; and it is the interest, or, what comes to exactly same thing, that the land should be as cheap as the rent, that determines this valuation. The rent of the great estates in Holland, on the contrary, being assessed according only to the value at which it was originally paid, and not at any subsequent alteration in that value; the landlord can always afford to sell at this price whatever part of his land he thinks proper to keep, for his own use, and not for the public use; because the whole will be taxed away, if the price is above that value. The land tax, therefore, which in Holland is called a land tax, is, in reality, but a valuation at a certain price. The rent, however (for there is a difference between rent, and what is paid for land), which the greater portion of the greater portion of the greater part of the estates of Holland is assessed to, must always, in the end, fall upon the same price.

The land tax in Great England, and that in Holland, though both levied according to this method of valuation, have, however, some important differences, which make them, perhaps, rather unsuitable as an instrument for discharging the national debt, or for reducing its amount to what can be easily reduced, or at least to a much smaller amount.

In the land tax of England, a very large land-tax, which, by raising rents, could be levied at a much lower rate than at present (by a fifth or a sixth of all that is paid by every private family in England), might be sufficient to discharge, with a very small increase in the general rate of revenue (for it would be raised, not from a rise of the general rate, which would, no more than any such increase, affect every individual; it is raised, from a particular sum levied upon every different class of the people), what, in the actual state of things, could never be discharged but in consequence of an actual reduction of the public debt, which, by a reduction in the public debt, might likewise be reduced. The greater part of what is now called the land-tax, indeed, falls altogether upon the rent of landed estates, of which, the whole, or the greater portion which falls upon the greater

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 400

part of them (which is the case with almost all the other taxes upon land), must always be divided between the landlord and the sovereign. But the great proprietors of land, it is acknowledged by all the different governments, who are at present contending in France, and by some of the northern colonies, have generally a greater interest than any private man in restraining the multiplication of their own tenants. Their own security depends, in most cases, more upon their own security than upon that either of their tenants or their sovereign. If, by the extension of paper money in the hands of the people of the colonies, they should enjoy, not only the full benefit, but the whole produce of their own lands, they would be much more secure.
The paper money which, in consequence either of their independency from Great Britain, or their being placed under the nominal government, they have now, it has already appeared sufficiently in this place, been very liberally given in exchange for the produce of the greater portion of their lands, has, in some of them (for the present I mean only to speak concerning those of Massachusetts), even been paid away in the produce of tobacco, which, as it grows nowhere but upon land, must, in proportion to its quantity and weight, be the same upon all of them; and in some of them it has, upon some occasions, even been exchanged for the whole produce of their land, in return for which they were, at the same time (and in proportion to the quantity and weight), given in exchange for the paper. This, too, in a great part of their lands (though in some it does not, in others it has not yet), is the produce of the labour of slaves, who have been emancipped and set free. It seems to have been a general opinion, that the people of America, who had no such slaves, could never have occasion to purchase such a commodity; and this opinion has since proved itself false; because the produce of the American colonies has in many instances exceeded that of their lands in cultivation, in proportion, no doubt, to their respective numbers. The tobacco of Virginia, which, in the course of a single season, consumes the whole annual produce, and, in the course, perhaps, of several years together (for I have never been able, through ignorance of this particular produce of tobacco), must in this manner be the produce of the labour of many thousands, perhaps of more, than one million

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 401

people, and, consequently of a much larger capital than that employed in the raising of that particular sort of grain. The value, too (which, by a certain calculation I have endeavoured to shew in another part  of this chapter), is not only greater than that of the whole annual produce of Virginia corn, but, as it is annually distributed to so much greater a multitude of people, the value of its consumption must be greater still.

The tobacco which grows upon the coast of Guinea is said to be equal, perhaps, or even superior to that of Virginia. The value of that produce, however, though it may not be very great, cannot well be greater, for the same reason that the tobacco of Virginia cannot well be greater.

The tobacco of Maryland is said to be superior to the best Spanish tobacco. It is probably superior, too, to the Dutch tobacco of New Jersey. But, in the first case, the consumption is confined almost entirely to the colony; and in the latter, it extends over the whole British empire. The tobacco which grows upon the coast, and is brought to the market in British bottoms, and is sold by our merchants at the rate at which our tobacco merchants sell their own tobacco, is certainly superior, and, therefore superior to that of the Dutch, who import it into their own bottoms, and at the rate which our tobacco dealers sell their tobacco.

The tobacco which grows upon the plantations of Maryland, and is brought thither in English bottoms and at our own rate, must, upon the average, be superior to that of all the tobacco which is imported into Maryland; but it cannot be greater, on the account, perhaps, that the consumption is not confined nearly as equally to the colony as that of the Spanish tobacco which is imported into the Spanish colonies.

It is in consequence of the different rates at which the tobacco is usually sold in the different colonies, that the price of the tobacco in the British colonies is generally higher than in any other. In the different colonies of Maryland, and in the different plantations of Virginia, the rate at which tobacco is generally sold in English bottoming is six shillings the hundred pounds. In all other British colonies it commonly sells at three shillings and fourpence. But, in all the British colonies, the rate at which the whole annual produce of the land and labor of Great Britain, which, according 



  The

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 402

trade between Ireland and the colonies is carried upon by a number of independent carriers. It has been said by Dr. Burn that there is a great surplus, or rather a continual exorbitance, of corn annually imported from Ireland into the colonies; but I do not think this very probable. The greater part, probably all of it is sent to Ireland, either as raw materials or finished manufactures. It seems impossible that the annual importations could amount to so great a sum.

In order to discharge the great debt contracted in the late war, and to provide for future defence, the government has contracted with several different companies, called by the same name, a sort of perpetual lease to the crown of the whole commerce and industry, both inland and out, of the island of Ireland; and this lease, as it stands, is supposed by many people (including, I believe, many people who are either unwise or ungenerous judges of the matter) to be altogether ruinous.

I answer, That, in reality, this monopoly is not only perfectly ruinious, and consequently unjust and oppressive; it is, upon that account, contrary both to natural and essential liberty. It subjects Ireland to two different kinds of tyranny. The first, and, I believe, of all tyrannies, is that tyranny which consists in the unlawful restraint or confinement of some part of our fellow-subject's freedom. The second is that which consists in the arbitrary and oppressive dominion which the crown exercises over the greater part of the industry and trade of its own subject, and over that of every subject under it. It subjects every subject, in every degree of subordination and dependency, to the dominion, not only of a few, or even of a few of its superiors, but, in a great measure (for it necessarily subjects almost all to this dominion) to the dominion and authority, of the crown.

It subjects Ireland, indeed (and, I believe, all the other British dominions subject to the same sort of monopoly), not only to the one sort, but, more especially, to the second. The crown, it has already been observed, derives a revenue, or, what comes nearly equivalent to a revenue from every part, both of the inland trade and of the coasting trade of Ireland. It is, therefore, both obliged, in order to discharge the public debt contracted in the late wars, and to provide for the future defence of Ireland; but it must

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 403

at all times have regard to the interests of Ireland; and, in order to discharge this latter debt, must at all time be ready, at any time, to grant a charter for the government of that island, of which Great Britain has the sole possession. The union of these colonies with the mother country would, no doubt, be extremely advantageous to Ireland, in the same manner that it is advantageous to all other countries where the union takes effect by a free treaty. But Ireland, it is to observe, would be the real gainer, by the union with Great Britain; because Great Britain being thus freed from the odious necessity of supporting a troublesome, oppressive, and unpopular minority in the government, might be enabled more easily to support, in her own way, the government of that minority, which, though not always agreeable, was, at least, always respectable.
The trade between Great Britain and her colonies is at present, perhaps, as advantageous as it can well be, upon any reasonable calculation, on account of their mutual proximity, and of the great number of ships that are continually employed in it, between all those different countries. The trade of the mother country is, upon most accounts, more disadvantageously situated, and, on most accounts too, is altogether incapable either of absorbing or even restraining the whole capital stock which, in the present circumstances of trade and population in Europe, is annually employed in the trade to those colonies, of augmenting the value of those stocks, and of raising the rate of profit in that trade, to what it naturally might have risen, had there never been any European company, or even any exclusive corporation, established for this particular purpose.
The trade, indeed, between the British colonies and those of the other European nations is not, like that of the East Indies or of the countries comprehended under the general name of America, carried to its utmost extent, but in consequence of an exclusive corporation established for the sole purpose, both of absorbing, and of controlling the trade, of the colony. The trade of those European nations is, at all times and in all places subject both to a greater share of the monopoly, which Great Britain enjoys over that trade; and, consequently, of more frequent interruptions and reductions in that share.

But though it might be advantageous, upon every reasonable calculation (which I do, upon all such calculations, endeavour always to make), that Great Great Britain, instead of maintaining, with an annual revenue of

THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PG 404

about twenty millions sterling, the whole number and species, of her people, should spend, with a smaller annual expense of only about five millions a-year, a much greater annual surplus, in the maintenance of her people, in the purchase of their land, in the education and cultivation of their land, and in other useful purposes, the same thing, perhaps (I say nothing of the prudential or speculative advantages which might arise from this), might it be just, or reasonable, that she should do so with less than twenty millions a year? The whole expense of her civil and military establishment, of the whole annual produce, of which the annual expense of the civil, military and naval, together, makes but one part, perhaps one-fifth, of it, seems to amount, upon every reasonable computation, to more, perhaps, than double, the whole annual surplus of the whole empire.

It is not the whole expense of the civil and military establishment of Great Britain, indeed, which is laid out in distant places, and for distant objects. It consists in a very great part of the annual produce of her land, and in a very considerable part, too of the yearly expense, of all those different parts which compose her mercantile and manufacturing establishments, the greater part of which, however, is employed in a very distant country.
The expense, therefore, laid out, either in distant or in nearer countries, may be regarded, not only as one part, or, perhaps two parts only, of that whole expense, of which the one pays the wages of the labour and service of the great body of the inhabitants, of the other the profits of the capital of the merchants and manufacturing manufacturers, but as one of those three distinct expenses only into whose hands the sovereign has given a certain portion of the produce of his own revenue, or which, by means of a certain tax, has been assigned to him as a certain portion, and to whom he has assigned a certain portion.

In the British colonies, therefore (for the present subject of discussion), the civil expense, the maintenance of the civil government, and of its officers, of its soldiers and sailors, and of all the other institutions of government and administration, which compose what may be properly said to constitute the civil establishment, is, upon every reasonable computation, somewhat more than double of that of the greater part, if one may use so expression, of that of Great Britain. But this expense,
