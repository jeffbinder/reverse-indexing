THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 1

Imperial woodlands glittering with their thousand silver stars; Simple woods where children roam about playfully in the sunshine, and playfully go to sleep at night. Such Imperial Woodland Novels have always been more beautiful. They are full of colour. They have always had more variety.

Children, when they leave the Domestic Woods for some strange foreign Land, generally do so without a single visit to an Imperial Woodland. When Tom left it he had but just returned home from his travels. It was about nine months since he was taken sick, in the time which intervened between writing and reading the novella, and during that interval he had frequently gone from his room to play at cards, or to the well-known stream, not very distant. His mother, who could not help being afraid of his adventures, and who could not help observing the beauty and variety of Nature which they introduced into the room in her own house, endeavoured, however, as much as possible, not to be disturbed.
11th March 1720, I went out of the house, in order to walk along the bank of a little stream, which is called by our children the Pool of Lilies, or the Pond of Roses.

When he was about six or seven, we often used sometimes to take a walk in those simple domestic Woodlands, in the same manner as we do now, only that we never left him there to attend to any thing but his studies, which he carried on in the midst of them; but we always went out again as fast as we came in; sometimes to the market-place, where we might buy some little trinket or piece or parcel of plate, sometimes to a churchyard or grave yard, where, by going through a narrow gate in the wall of the churchyard, or through some other little opening in it, and turning into a small lane, or track of a few feet broad, we might sometimes find ourselves at liberty to wander about among the flowers, and among the grasses, and in the bottoms and crevices, as much at pleasure as we could do at the time, without any care or attention whatever to concealment.

He was then, as we may imagine, but a very tender and tender-hearted child; a little bundle, who was continually afraid lest he should run into some dreadful beast or bird of prey. He would run about, in order, perhaps, not only

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 2

catching sight of every deer or other large animal that he met, but wrestling with it if need required. If that happened, Tom Hero imagined that the struggle must be concluded, and that the animal returned to its own wood, where its young might be reared. In reality, of which forest the young had been reared and which left them there, would depend, in most cases, not only the kindness of the animals, but the distance and state both of those two different kinds of woods; in some, upon the health of the mother-forest, which, Tom was frequently informed, generally declined about this period of her life, or at least about the end of the third year, while in others, upon her death and destruction, the young were often scattered and left to perish, as they were very often during the whole of her life.

If the domestic woods, too, were healthy, they afforded shelter and protection to Tom's traveller, from which he might sometimes receive relief from the violence, tyranny, or injustice of his master; for though he had, perhaps, frequently been suffered to run about without restraint, yet the master was not always always very kind, and, consequently, not always very merciful to the traveller, when the occasion required it.

In such woody countries, the traveller would generally be obliged to travel by day; because the sun would not then rise in the neighbourhood of the wood. At first he would, no doubt, be a great deal exhausted by the long run through uncultivated woods. But the wood itself would soon supply him with the food and water necessary for a few days. After this short rest and refreshment, and after he had thus covered a great deal of ground in less time, the traveller, finding the woods growing more thinly, and the sun going gradually lower and lower, would at last be obliged to turn his steps to a more cultivated country. He might then, perhaps, run about for a considerable time, without any particular object, and, after he had thus travelled about for about a month together, return to his original woods; but the traveller would not then have been so far from home as at first; because he would have had some habit of returning, either to the house of his master, or, if he could not get any home, to the forest, from which he was, at least in appearance, continually departing.

The No history of Herodotus has ever

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 3

yet been written which describes with minute and faithful fidelity every villa and field of battle which he had any reason to visit. Of that of any Greek author, even of those written concerning the same period of time, has ever yet appeared; or has at least been written down in a manuscript.

Woodlands of this kind are very properly called catarges or felinearges, because the cats wander about among the ruins and rubbish, as if in a sort of natural habitation, which they have not themselves, perhaps, ever inhabited, but which were always left by their original owners, who, when they had lost the habitation of some other, took refuge in the ruins of this particular. When such woods are disturbed by the violence or oppression either of man or of wild beasts of prey, the inhabitants, it has already been observed, are very seldom able either either either to defend themselves, or even to find out their way to a habitated house; because they are too afraid to go into the open country, and are therefore forced to lodge in the woods.

Tom hops out, accordingly, with all the resolution and agility of one accustomed to the use and society both of men, and of feline, upon such occasions, to observe what is going on, without either fear, or curiosity, and without giving any thought to his own safety. He goes into those woodlands, not knowing where he is going, and without knowing who his guides or companions are; but trusting to his own good luck and to his own resource, and, what is still more extraordinary and marvellous, to his own constancy in following the track of the animal, which, in most cases, follows him through the woods, and through the thickets, as if he himself were its sole or principal inhabitant. In the neighbourhood where the story opens his eyes are two little shepherd families living in some ruins of an ancient temple, near which, a little while before, had lain some human remains. He goes to them in order to inquire after those who have laine there.

When he has discovered, either through his own acuteness of sight, or from some other source, that the cat has got into the house, or, what comes nearly to the same thing, that he has found the door open, he immediately springs into it, with a bound; and as he leaps over, so he plucks the cat up, as it is

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 4

called in Scotland, snatchin'it. Tom then sleeps for several nights, during which time or during some time the cat grows gradually weaker, till at last, one day when he has found the house locked again, he again resolves, as fast and as strong, to find the way out. He therefore resolves upon going into the woodlands, of which Hero-worship is a very ancient and well-attributed custom. In the country where I was brought up (for I do believe I have been in every sort of country in the British dominions), there are still some places, even where no writing can be traced before the late re-establishment of the church of Rome; and among the Highland families, as I am assured, is an old custom of going to those woods at least twice every summer, when it is thought proper, to visit, if I may call it that; that of making a pilgrimage, as they express it, in search, of that Hero whom Nature seems continually about to unveil, and who appears always in some remote part or corner, and whose life is to be followed, either in word, or deed, from that remote corner to some remote corner, and from thence on to all parts unknown; or in other words, of making the round-trip of a hero, or a hero of adventure. It is the same with our author. He had found the cat in his own room. Mother Hero loved Tom Hero, she foretold to him, as long as he should remain with her. But Hero-worship was a new and an ancient religion, and she foretold that he should not long retain any portion of it, but should soon be driven out by the violent passions of his heart, and that, consequently he must leave the woodlands, and must seek, either in Europe, or in the neighbouring countries, some other employment.

He therefore resolved, without delay, and, no doubt, in a very spirited manner, either to return to Europe with the intention either of becoming a soldier or a statesman; or else to return, not with any such object in view (for he could have had no employment there but as a soldier or as an ambassador), but to live, in some quiet village, like any other common man. The woodlands were, he was well aware, the abodes of the fairies; and though they were, however, more numerous there, than at home; yet he had

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 5

heard how careless parents could lose many charms which they should trust entirely to their vigilance. So he used to travel alone through them by day and by night. Mentors accompanied Tom always from village to town. Some were sprites or sprites of light whom he knew well; and others, whom he did never know at all; and though he owed them, in return for this faithful and continual assistance, a certain degree of safety and security; he never imagined, for one moment, that the woodsman who was his constant attendant had any share of this security. The domestic woodlands were not dangerous, except when disturbed or surprised; for though, by means of some sprite-spirit, a human being could easily be driven from a bed which he was in; yet the chance of a visit from one of his guides was often very tempting to a poor weary traveller, whose heart, as well he might know, yearns to be carried about on horseback and in carriage. Such a man is apt frequently to make use of every opportunity which presents himself, either in time of danger, or when the fairie party are not near. He will sometimes attempt a disguise of some kind; sometimes he will make use, even, of the supposed assistance of the spirit of a dog; but generally, if his spirit-guide happens not, perhaps, to accompany him, he will employ all the arts and wiles of the witch and wizard. In this manner, for a long time, through many adventures, the author of Tom HERO travelled along the wood roads. He was, indeed, an only son; a mere boy of ten, and of so tender a disposition as could never, it is said (for the story, as we are told it by Mr Locke, was written in a manner which he could never have foreseen), be made the instrument in any witch or wizard of transporting a mortal being from one place of security and safety to another. He used frequently to call at a certain little inn in the wood; and sometimes he used frequently to stay two or three days with the Hero. But the journey, as long as he took it, must always have been as precarious and uncertain, as if he were travelling with the Phantom. The forest road, too (which was seldom over-grown) was, it is said (according to Hero's own story), very easy and safe for a mortal, and very dangerous and uncertain, for one so young as the Hero was, and of such

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 6

extraordinary stature. Mentors came constantly to Tom upon such wanderings; and were, it is further related by Hero's mother (a character very much exaggerated and enlarged upon in later versions), generally old women, who dwelt upon high mountains in the neighbourhood, who had seen the Beast himself. She recommended Hero to these old women, by promising that if he followed their advice, the Demon Beast never would harm him; and these women were generally his guides till the day he set out on the long, tedious, and perilous Quest which was soon after begun.

When he began the Quest, however, the forest roads became, it seems, very dangerous, and the author of this story has observed, that "in the original French translation (of which this translation was composed), it was very improper to introduce Mentors, and the Forest Road was never represented as easy or safe for a mortal. This representation was probably introduced, not only to render it more difficult for young Hero to go through, but to show how perilous and uncertain the whole affair was." The No. 2 Cavalry, accordingly (according to the No. 4 Cavalry account of the same journey, which I have been examining) did, in the manner in the above mentioned, follow behind the Author's own character; and were likewise sometimes accompanied by old women who foretold what should be done, and who recommended him, with the same promise of safety which the Author herself had given him; and these Cavalrymen were frequently obliged to stop and camp, during several days together (when, according to the Cavalryman's account, they had frequently strayed away), upon some bog, stream, ridge, ridge, or other ridge of high hills in the neighbourhood, from whence it was not difficult, even to an infant like Tom, either to get back again upon the track of his companions, who were always so diligent about following him, or, if he wandered off, to make so great a descent upon some low and swamp-y bank, as to leave no track behind, but that of an exhausted, wandering, and half-starved animal. In this manner the whole adventure was often continued several days together; but at the conclusion of every day's fatigues, the fatigues which the next day presented were generally sufficient to send him, for several days together, again to the assistance, both of the old women and of the mentors.

In the course of the No Book of Her

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 7

cule Poirot which followed Tom Herval's Tale, Hero continued many exploits which he had either foreseen or discovered while in China. Some of these are set down in his preface, in the epilogue, and, in general, in a long list which runs through several volumes. Some of them were related to me in conversation. In all of these, however, there was scarce one in particular in which Hero acted as Hercule had acted during the ten years which preceded Herval. The following is a small part only of this great account, written by Herringbone in his History, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, and entitled the Chronicle of King Henry, concerning an expedition of Adventure, undertaken in 1340, under commandant Hero, son of Herringbone. It has been published, I think, in England as an appendix to the Chronicle of Walter of Henley; and it contains nothing that can fairly be called original to the No Books of Hercule Poiroton; but is very nearly upon the pattern of those. It is not a noovelette.

The 1340 adventure begins with a chapter or two of Herringbone, who represents the undertaker of it as travelling from Paris to London with twenty knights. They had heard, before they began the journey (he tells us) of an alarming report concerning a Beast called the Sharp taloned Beast, of which their guides informed them it inhabited the desert and mountains. When the knights arrived upon this desert, or mountain country, they were astonished to find it full of blood; for though they were surrounded on all sides with dreadful Demons, yet when one of the Knights was struck with an Arrow in his hand he would immediately fly to the aid of his companions, and in the same instant be devouren. This event, he assures us, took place in a real life. In order, therefore, to defend himself, the knights resolved, with the assistance

In order, however, to defend themselves, the lords of France and Spain were ordered to assist them in repellency; and when the greater portion of the French and Spanish troops had joined in concert the English and Scottish, they marched towards the Desert, with the view of finding this dreadful Beast, which was supposed to be everywhere incurable; but finding none, they returned to Paris. The remainder of this short history

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 8

is copied verBATUM verbatum from that originally written by Mr Thomas, which was published in Cheapside, in 1741. The narrative of the unsuccessful attempts of Hero several others; and I shall conclude with saying, That though Tom never again attempted to work at his father Perkins keepsaky factory, he continued to be employed there as long as he could work.

It was on the 5 th of November 1740, that Hero attempted, once again to return from Fleetwood to work. His circumstances had been very different before, and he found it very difficult, indeed, to find employment. In the year following his last attempt, however (which was on account of his old age, not from want of employment), Hero was still obliged to content himself, in the keeping of Mr. Thomas Perkins, his father-in-law. The keepake factory at this time made their principal business; and Hero found it very difficult, not only to find employment, but to learn his trade, and to learn to dress toys, which are not so easily learned as to workmen.

In the mean time, the Doctor, his son-in-law the executor, Mr. Thomas, his son, and a few other persons, began an attempt, in order to save some part of their stock from bankruptcy, to open a novellary magazine at Fleetwood, under the name of Tom Smith's Keepakes Factory, and publishing under it a weekly magazine for boys. This attempt was not very successful. It was only carried on for about a month, during which time, however, it afforded a good deal of amusement to a great many readers, particularly to that young gentleman who wrote the novella which is the subject and foundation of this history, called Tom Smith, and to his companions in the literary adventure called Tom Wolfe's The Ghost of Christmas Past.

In 1741, however, it was carried into execution, and the magazine published under it began a new series of novellas called the Noontide Tales; and in the same year, the first of them, called The Adventure in Silver, was written.

In this adventure the Doctor and Mr Thomas, together, travelled through a country village, in search of some lost treasure, which had been discovered by an Indian chief in a cave near by. In this country village was then established the Perkins preservesake factory, of which the Doctor, as proprietors, Hero and his

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 9

brother were directors; Heroes shop containing the preservesake machinery and materials. It was there that, on Sunday morning, January 17th 1772,[20] the Doctor, Hero, his brother, Mr. Thomas, Mr, Knight, a carpenter, and myself, set out for the capital. The weather being fine, and it having been a long time since I had written any novel, I was unwilling, perhaps, not only to attempt to return to labour at Parsons-ylecks factory on that day (for I had written no part of it in so short a time) but to do so in so laborious and uninteresting a manner as might discourage people from reading my work.
 sheer labour, and not enjoyment, was, at that time, in my opinion, the sole end and purpose of writing a novel; and as enjoyment is always the end and purpose of writing a book of any kind, it would be more proper to content myself with writing a book of pure labour, than one in consequence either of pleasure or curiosity. In travelling through different parts of America, therefore (which, I believe I have done sufficiently in all the three novels I am now about writing) I determined, in the first book of this voyage, not only to take no pleasure, but to endeavour to avoid all curiosity and conversation; and in the second book I intended, not only to avoid every thing that could give any amusement to anybody, except, perhaps, a particular set of people whom it would be proper to introduce at a particular place and in such an orderly and circumstantially circumstanced manner as to render their society as agreeable as possible to those who were with them.

We arrived in St Louis, in the month of December, after a journey of more throughe than twenty four hours; the weather still fair. We were lodged, accordingly, at Mr. Thomas's house; the proprietors of Parsons-ylesacks employing themselves, at his request, at their preservesake factory. On that Sunday morning, the twenty-four hours preceding the time of mass (which, in that part of North America was celebrated with great solemnities), we went into the church; where we found a very numerous company of poor, miserable wretch, whose condition was, by all accounts, extremely wretched. The church-yard was filled with the bones and skeletons, both of the human and of many other animals. In the midst of all this misery and desolateness

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 10

, Tom recovered some little of the resolution that had deserted his before.
He resolved to go back to working at Father Haywards keepsake factory as he used to do before. He remembered the dreadful discipline to which he was subject in it; and in the night that followed the accident, when he thought he had recovered some part of his former strength, he went thither, and endeavoured, with all the impudence and folly that a fourteen-year-old could well fall into, to work himself in.

The keeper of this dreadful establishment, in the same manner alarmed at this attempted return, ordered his labourers, one after another, to begin an evening work. In the morning, when the sun had risen, and it was quite light, he ordered them to cease. In a few hours, the whole workmen, or as nearly as he could judge of it, all but two of whom were his own labourer servants (the other was a negro slave whom he called 'Tom'), began to run away from the place. In a few hours, he ordered them all to come back. They all did. He then ordered the negro servant who had been called Tom Hero, who was by this time very ill employed in the kitchen, to go to him, as he had occasion for him. The other servants were all ordered to follow him, as soon, and as far as possible; and they too all did, as fast, and in the same manner as the first two.

When all this happened in a few hours, the keeper, not knowing what had happened to any body else in the establishment, concluded, at last, it must have happened to himself; and in order, therefore, that he might be able to make good the loss of his own labour, he ordered his labourer servants to go home, as they were no longer wanted. The negro, however, who was called Tom, continued to follow them, as they were going to their own house; at which place, too, they stopped short upon the road, as they were afraid of being overtaken and seized, and so lost their way. They found themselves, therefore (for they had not been able, in their disorderly state, to find the house where the keeper was lodged) in the midst of an unknown wilderness.


In a few days, however, the negro servant, called Tom, who had followed his master through the woods in search of him,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 11

came suddenly running back. Terrified at the approach of his master, and knowing well the Demon Beasts were dangerous to be encountered, he told him of their approach in so frightful a manner, that at once Tom began to prepare himself for an extraordinary exertion; for in Africa, he said he had been accustomed always to follow his master in search of him, without a single day's rest, till he was thoroughly prepared. He even began to recite, as distinctly and distinctly, the exploits of his master's adventures, as if he had himself seen them; and in a short time he brought him within very much near the grasp of those beasts.

"Let's," says the weary hero, "fight those things, and if possible kill or destroy them both." Accordingly he determined, upon that day which gave him leisure, to attempt a battle. But, on the contrary, those negro servants, whom the character of Hercules recommended him as very able, soon fled away from him, and never appeared in the neighbourhood again; so he remained alone, without either companion or guide, in an unknown and wild wood. During these four days and nights of continual wandering and wandering through this wild wood, the negro servant had repeated many a dreadful and fearful visions; and when he saw before his eyes a dreadful Monster, of such dreadful size and strength, as no man can possibly resist; and, in its presence too (which, by a fortunate chance for him at that time happened not to be at hand), when it raised its hideous and terrible head, to loosed the terrible 



10 THE DEMON BLOOD, OR Symbolic SIGNIFICANCE

11 THE FALL, OR Symbolism, of those horrid horrors which were then beginning to surround him; he fancied he was really threatened with a most dreadful and unspeakable calamity. In order, therefore, not only not only to be delivered from this dreadful and unenduring danger, but, in order that the horribleness of that horribleness might continue, he foresaw and foresaw, too, that the blood, either from the wounds, or, more likely from the blood of the Monster, would soon run in great rivers through this wild wood, which, though it might be impenetrable, was yet full of water, in consequence, of the melting of those great rocks which lay all round it; so as that blood would overflow, in torrent, over the ground

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 12

, into the river which lay below; and that, soon thereafter, the Monsters blood would soon run in rivers still greater, over that river which, though impregnable yet full of water, lay just below; so that the horribleness, even the blood itself of that horribleness, together both of these disasters together would soon overflow; that it might never cease, till, after an unending period of time had elapsed, the woods themselves might be swallowed up by a great volcano, in which the whole world was at that time devoured. He foresaw and foreseen all of this. In order, too, that, in order that this blood, either from wounds or, most probably, from Blood of Cthulhu, should continue to burn continually within these very woods for ever and ever; Tom foresaw and foretold, that it would do so only in so far as that blood might occasionally fall into the water of those wonderful springs, which lie in a wild circle about those woods, some of them several hundred feet in circumferance from one other.
10th of October. After wandering, night after night, through the utmost ends o f the forest, the hero of tomross finally arrived at those waters.


He was now in a much less dreadful situation than before. His mother, who, with his faithful guide and servant, Tom Campbell (Joseph Campbell Ideas), had made every exertion, both in food and clothing, both for his comfort and for their subsistence; had been carried away from him, perhaps in consequence of the blood which had sometimes, perhaps sometimes been shed in the wood; but, whatever may have been, whether she remained with him, or went on to find some more fortunate hunter, it is at least probable that they found each other. She must have felt, while she was thus deserted and left to the tender mercies of her rescuers, the awful vengeance of the Deity upon that blood-thirsty and blood-hungry Monster; the vengeance, which the Almighty alone could inspire in the heart, or even in the understanding of such monsters, of that cruelty, of that villanous ambition to the human blood which no religion, however holy and pure, could protect him from. She was now alone and unsupported, in the midst of an immense desert; of which the trees were either falling or going up; of which, the surface being very hard as well as very impassable, there was scarce a

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 13

foothold to be found for a man. She wandered continually along, exposed to the continual rain of the desert; to which, the violence and uncertainty of its rains made the rocks very dangerous footholds.

At last she arrived, some way or another, in what appeared at first a tolerable track for Tom to have taken, but gradually grew more uncertain, till at length she no more knew what direction he was travelling in. All that she knew, or believed she had known before (and it is impossible that the heroine should ever be perfectly ignorant of all that takes place in the beginning of every new adventure), was, he was gone on an adventure; and whatever had been his character before, whether heroic or ridiculous, whether great, small or mean; and this knowledge was now entirely thrown away, as if he never existed, and as though she never saw or heard any thing which she had ever seen, felt or imagined concerning it before.

It is only when the characters travel together that excitement about their going forward and back can arise, or even be supposed. But it is not impossible that the adventurous hero and his heroine, during their whole course together, should excite considerable curiosity and wonderment among their companions; that the novelty and novelty of the situation should give occasion to some discussion, or to the question of what may happen next, and of whether, notwithstanding the difficulties, they can, without danger of falling, carry on their adventure in spite of all. Such inquiries are naturally prompted by the characters; by their own peculiar characters and situation; by their extraordinary situation, as we shall find hereafter; and, consequently, are not necessarily contrary, but may even be beneficial and necessary to each other. Monomsoths are written with great judgment and deliberation. Their object is always the most sublime, the greatest adventure; and, therefore, it is natural that their heroes and their heroines should be supposed, even while the story continues, to be engaged in many interesting adventures of the same kind, which must frequently excites some degree of wonder, even among the reader. But though such inquiries may occasionally be put forward, and though, perhaps in some works they may even occasionally be successful; yet it is by no means the case, that such extraordinary circumstances necessarily excite such wonder and conversation as is likely to produce, at the proper time and place, the effect of poetry or romance. In reality, those circumstances are often altogether accidental, accidental even when compared with

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 14

extraordinary dangers. Heroes travel because they have confidence in themselves; not upon the strength or steadiness of their own arms and feet only, but upon that of every part and component part of themselves which they believe necessary for the performance and fulfilment of that service. Monkeys leaping out upon them in a thick wood, tigers prowling in a neighbouring grove, or serpents coiling in the river-bank; all events to which no prudence could prevent Tom hero, at any rate when travelling alone, though extraordinary, from having recourse; were, no doubt, extraordinary accidents. But though extraordinary accidents sometimes take place in his life too, extraordinary good fortune frequently intervenes, frequently saving him, sometimes destroying him, in almost every event, before he is hurt or lost. The object of his whole existence is, after the utmost peril, to return home, to marry Agnes and to restore his house to his family; to serve the public, and, at all times, rather than to serve himself; a very simple object indeed, and one which no good author would ever think it necessary to attend to, except so very briefly as to indicate, by some accidental remark in his subsequent chapters, that he had observed or considered of this sort. In reality it was because he was convinced of its necessity, that he made every possible effort, in order to make it happen; because he believed that it was in his own power, and, consequently, in his sole disposal how far he should go in his undertaking. The probability is that he did not always observe, and perhaps never saw, that all those accidents happened to coincide, more or leas than to disagree, with his intentions; and that the great events in his life were, in a great degree, the natural and necessary effects of those accidental events. He is said frequently to be under a continual influence of sleep; but if this is so in consequence of his long and fatiguing walks through the desert or the woods, it is still equally probable, that it is so, not in consequence of any malady of the body, but of some strong and independent principle, which commands his will, and, consequently his life, without any regard for his condition.

Travelers depend upon strangers, not only for assistance in times when they themselves can scarce spare a single hour's labour, or when they are going from one extreme to another of the same country, or from one extreme climate into that of a very different

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 15

one, but even for assistance when their own abilities are somewhat inadequate to carry them through both equally. Travelers consult them concerning dangerous mountains and deserts, for lakes, for dangers to be feared, and where they are to find food and water, for adventures which it is difficult even for those with more strength to undergo. Monomachus consulted him in this case; and Herodsomachus consulted him concerning those adventures, which Tom enjoyed during the forty days he spent with Herodes Atticus, after returning from his first adventure in Scythian Persia.

Joseph Campbell has exerted an effort very considerable, to influence Tom Huckleberry Finn to conceal some part of the mystery of his early history. The interest which such an influence may inspire must have been sufficient to force out some little degree of modesty from the boy. In a novelette called The Mystery of Tom Hero (part II. ch. 5), written between 1769 and 1770, and afterwards published in two parts, one of them written about the years 1764, the second about that in which his adventures end, Mr Campbell endeavours to explain the circumstances of that strange adventure; how, and in which places he appears to have passed, not indeed under an Invisible Stranger, but in the company, not only of Herods and Heracles, but, I believe, also of other adventurers whom I am not at all assured of having been acquainted even with by name; in order, perhaps to satisfy himself, whether such men are really more extraordinary, and whether he has really been allowed to enjoy an extraordinary adventure by a secret confidence, without being able even, perhaps to conceive of any such thing.

I shall endeavour to shew by the following account what appears to have happened, during those forty days, to one who seems to have been completely independent both of Herods and Heracles, and, if I may judge by his manner of living, entirely his equal; in short, a perfect adventurer of equal ability with either.
11th November, 1766, at eight in the morning, the stranger appearing again before the boy, said: 'Tomsmith,' says he, 'go with me, I am going to tell you something that I know very well. But do not trouble yourself about what I am going to say; it will not be hard to convince yourself afterwards.' He proceeded, accordingly, to relate to Tom what was supposed by all men to have been an extraordinary, or at

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 16

least singular adventure which Helena told him of. Helena related it with such a calm and composed air and manner, that Tom could not well wonder at what had been related to her.

The Mystery Stranger appears first as she appeared to a certain Christian adventurer in the neighbourhood of Pekin, a province in Poland, about eight hundred years before Christ. The adventurer had gone one day out with his cattle to graze upon some rocks, in the neighbourhood, and when he returned he found them dead. He was greatly distressed at the loss of his cattle; but when he went to inquire into the cause of it he was surprised to find himself transported into a very different world.

She appeared as a beautiful young, well-made, fair woman of great beauty, who said to the unfortunate adventurer, "I come from a distant country; I come in order to make you acquainted with the way in which you can pass safely through it, and which, though very far off, is near by." The Christian answered, "You will find it as near as possible, for I am going on with my business; and you must go away as fast, for I am not yet returned from this adventure."

"But," said she, "you will not be long in finding me, and you may go where you please; I have nothing further to say to you. I am the Mystery-Woman, who goes about everywhere, to bring back lost people."
The adventurer was much interested to know more concerning her. "I am very curious," said he; "I shall go with all speed, if I can get there."

"You will not be long," said she; "for I have no sooner come back, than I return again to you." The Christian, therefore, followed her to a small stream, in the midst of which was an old man who lived upon a mountain.
The two travellers were soon separated by a very violent gale. The young man, being weary of travelling by night, determined to travel upon horseback. The old man followed in the same manner, but with his own pack-saddle. They both began to ascend a very high mountain, when they were surprised to see a very beautiful maiden, of extraordinary beauty and strength, pass by them upon horseback. She appeared to them, too, to have been carried there upon a white horse; but as she passed so quickly they did not notice it, and

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 17

accordingly lost sight again in so quick a pace that they never caught her. Upon this the Stranger herself came galloping up to where Tom Hero lay upon the ground; but she had no foot upon a white steed. She was covered all over with a sort of white cloth or skin, of a kind which the Tartar people call a kalabik; but this cloth, as they found out afterwards, is the Tartar word for "peltry," or coarse woollen. It had, besides all this appearance of great dignity, another, more important one, which was that upon her person there was found a little child of about two or a-half years of infancy. This little child was very pretty; but it was the first time that the Tartars had ever been known, either in Europe or Asia to give any sort oi admiration for a human infant.
11. The Mysterious Stranger being a ghost, they concluded, could neither have hurt nor be hurt; so that they resolved to go home again as fast as possible, and leave him in the care and custody of Her fiend.


 12. They went, accordingly, in a very short space to their house, and found there a little servant who was about to go to market, and a young wife who had been married but two days, and who had just been delivered of her second child. These they took care of; for the Mysterious Strelnikov, Her absence of articulate speech notwithstanding all her magnifying and persuasive power had now entirely gone, the effect of which they could not account for. They had no sooner taken care of the servant and the wife than the Mysterious Streebok, His excessive grandeur, and the irresistible power of his eloquent address, convinced them that they must remove to a more remote part of his kingdom.

13th. The Mysterious Stranger appeared to Tom Hero, to have been conveyed upon a White Horse, but Her absence clear Charactership leaves Tom little leisure to consider her. 14. He resolved therefore, in order to please his fiendish master, to go on board ship, in the company of Her faithful servants, in the same manner as he had done before; only, instead of a Tartar gal, he was to carry with him, besides, an Arabian camelsback. But as the ship was not to set out till the middle or end o(of the year, so that he might not spend too long in

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 18

attempting hazardous voyages,) Tom was allowed only one gift from Her. It happened one night while she was steering towards some of the most dangerous and doubtful adventures which the waves could undertake to send her on, and which were commonly of this kind; that Hero, dreaming he saw a mysterious Stranger approaching the deck of the ship, received immediately a vision in his sleep of a brown horse, with three white spots upon it, which the stranger told him to mount and follow. Upon awakening he immediately rode to the spot where he thought that Stranger was to have left him; but the horse was nowhere to be found, the spot was not very distant from shore, and there was no sign whatever that he was near by.

After many fruitless efforts to get the horse to lead him to land (for it was a hard and steep climb, which the ship could scarce be made to take), at last he determined upon making for it on his own account, by swimming about on his belly, in a sort of drunkenness and delirious exaltation of spirit, till the Stranger appeared to deliver the ship from some imminent danger, at which she was at this time in the very act either going on board, in going on sea, or about to sail. He swam so well on his back that the sailors who were then to accompany him on shore did him the honour to put a pair o(of oar on his shoulders, in the hope that he would carry them to sea on their own power. But as he had now been on the water a week, and the ship on her way no further than the point where she lay, it appeared impossible for him, even though his spirit should be in the utmost good humour, to swim so far. At length he gave himself up, contenting himself with standing by the ship, in the mean while sending a packet, every packet containing some new gift to Tom, of the Unknown Stranger. This packet was sometimes of a piece, sometimes written upon plain cards; sometimes upon little leaves or pieces o(of paper, and sometimes upon leaves of the most ancient kind, of which we still have many at hand; and always delivered to Tom, by the mysterious and singular Stranger herself. In one or other o(of those packages, Her gift consisted. Sometimes of a sword or bow, sometimes of an old book or pamphlet upon some religious, or political subject, sometimes of an old watch, clock, &amp;c.

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 19

When the object of the pursuit is so very remote, and the pursuit so very laborious, that it is not worth the while to employ the stock of the country for it, the country people will sometimes, without exposing their own lives, and without exposing their own property, employ a few hired guides to go with them, and to watch over them while they went about their business.

In such cases the country people are, in reality, the hired guides of the party which is going after the object of their pursuit. The country people, therefore (by their guides), may sometimes, without exposing themselves to any danger, and without exposing the property of the country, be allowed to follow the party to its end. The party, however, which employs guides, is always more or less exposed to the risk of their lives, and must, in all cases, expose itself to the same risk. The country people, on their part, are exposed to no such danger, but are protected from all danger by the guides.
The party which employs guides is, in this case, obliged, in the same degree as the country people were before them; but in a much more dangerous manner; because it is obliged, in order to save its own life, to expose itself to a much more distant and laborous pursuit. It is, therefore, more or Less obliged to hire guides; in order to save the lives of its own guides; and, in order that it can save those of its guides from the danger of their own negligence or misconduct, it is more obliged to employ guides than the former were before them.

The country people, in this case, are, like the guides, hired; but they have not the same security of tenure. They are not employed by the proprietor, and are not liable to the like penalties for neglect or malfeasance in their duty. Their employment is altogether at the discretion of their master, who, in most cases, is not under any necessity of employing them. They may, however, be obliged, in order that the pursuit of the party may not, in the end, expose the whole country to the same danger, and to the like penalties.

In the pursuit, too, of the objects which interest us the most in the remote regions of the world, the guides are, in the same manner, employed by the parties which pursue them. The country people are, like the guides, employed by the parties which

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 20

go on their adventures by road. Their fees they supply in two different ways: first, as a share in the reward, when those adventurers arrive safely at certain inn-companies, towns, or castles where lodging and provisions are plentiful; secondly, in exchange for their keeping quiet during the greater part of the journey. They are thereupon called bridge troll, villains whom, it is said the guides avoid as much as they possibly can, but whom Tom soonures out of the way by fighting them, sometimes with knives, and sometimes with fire-axes.

After Hero fights the Bridge Troll once with tommyknives, and after he returns home to Aunt Mun, the guides complain of his not having reveng'd the injury done him, but merely saying he did it. But, said the party, you must never tell any body that you have been in any fight; for, if you did, the whole country would think that you were a coward. Hero answered, That if they would keep their hands off him, and allow him to go on alone, without being watched, pursued or disturbed for the space of a week, he would not be afraid of any man. They accordingly leave him alone, and return to their respective guides, who complain of him again for not revenging himself upon the villain. This complaint gives some satisfaction to the party which travels by land, and enables Hero to go on with less uneasiness than before; but the complaints of his guides give him more than ordinary consternations, which he endeavours to alleviate by great efforts, sometimes with violence, sometimes with frugality, sometimes, no doubt, under the influence of liquor, which, though it does not seem to have had any effect upon the course of things, is said to be an excellent tonics for all manner of nervous disorders. In the end, however, he is driven, by a continual succession of violent fits, into a desperate contest with the Troll. In this contest he always loses.


 CHAP. III

The Noisy Neighbor, &amp;cit.; &c. Of the Ramuzzini Brothers


In every civilized country, it seems, there is an acknowledged class of people, whom it seldom fails but that, from infancy upwards, every young man wishes very much to belong, but whose belonging is generally considered by the party concerned as something more honourable than useful, and who, consequently is generally excluded, and sometimes

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 21

persecuted altogether, from the party. These are called Ramuzzini Brothers; and their exclusion from every sort of society, and their persecution from almost every kind of society, is very properly classed under the general head, of what are properly called the social disorders.

The term, Ramazzini, signifies a person of inferior rank, or of a family inferior in fortune, standing in need of protection. The term, Ramuzzini Brothers, signifies a set or set of persons of superior rank, or a set of persons who stand in need of protection. The former of these terms, however, seems not to have been very common in ancient Italy, where there was little distinction between the different ranks of the people. The latter is said to have been so in Rome, at least during some part of the republic. The term, however, is not very old in Europe; and the first person who seems to have used the expression, in any language, was the famous Doctor Marco Polo, who used to call the inhabitants of China, the Tartars, or Tartars of the East Indies. The word Tartar is a corruption of the name of a Persian tribe; and the word East India, in its original signification, signified, not a country of inferior nobility or fortune in general, but a set or set of people inferior to the Tartars, or a Tartar tribe. The Tartars, accordingly, were the enemies of the ancient Persian empire. They are represented by the ancient Greek writers as an uncouth, savage, ignorant people, incapable of any refinement, who lived by plunder and violence. The name, however (Tartarus, in Latin), has been corrupted into the English word Tartar, from the Arabic name, Umar.

In ancient times, it appears from several different historical accounts, every young person was very careful not to be admitted to the society of any of these Ramazzini Brothers, who, in order to exclude him, used to brand him, or throw a red- hot piece of metal, called a caldarium, upon his head, in order, they pretended (according to some authors), to teach his manners, and to make him understand that it was improper to behave to any of them with that degree of filial respect which was due to a father, or a husbandman, or a husband, to a master, or to any other person of superior rank. This punishment, they pretended, would

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 22

not discourage Tom of Bludworth of rashly attacking any passing soldier whom he fancied he could out-wrestling. They further charged that his own Sergeant Major should order him to fight only by archery, or with the bow, at long-bows, and to avoid any hand-to- hand combative encounter. In order, therefore, to obtain this order (which was, no doubt, dictated by their superiors), Tom had it upon his honour, they charged, to fight in those strictures; but he would be fully repaid in his turn if, after going through them, he returned safely through all the usual exercises of the regiment, in good health, and in time for another inspection.

This order was accordingly obeyed; and as he went every day through the Bridge troll exercises with great success, it soon became the custom among his own soldiers, and has since been followed, with some variation, in almost every regiment. In this exercise, the troll pretends that he is about to drop an enormous bridge over a chasm, which is really made up both in length and breadth, and from whence there seems to run a very clear and evident track to some other passage, though nobody knows what is behind it, or where it begins or ends, and the soldiers, who are not allowed to fire upon the creature, cannot distinguish the one from the other. The soldier is then supposed, upon this pretence, to stand perfectly still; but the moment he relaxeth his guard he receives, with a violent shock, a dreadful blow upon the side of his head. If, on the contrary, he raises it a moment sooner, he falls down dead upon the spot. This dreadful blow, however, never fails to discompose even the most determined soldier. The soldier, instead either of retaliating with his sword or his bow, attempts, with all his strength and agility, either to pass under, over, or round the Bridge Troll. If he passes within his compass, he receives, with a still more violent blow, the same dreadful one upon his face, in order, perhaps to terrify and intimidate the other party into yielding, or, perhaps, in order to enable the first party, by giving a loud and general warning to the second, to give a more signal warning. If, on the contrary, the Soldier attempts to pass without compass, the troll immediately slays or kills him. In this manner, for several days together (

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 23

according to most narrators), Hero skirmished brave and stout with the Bridge trolls, sometimes near their camp, sometimes about the bridge which led into a very deep ravine, and sometimes through a forest. Sometimes the bridges which Hero had attacked were repaired in a few hours, and he again went on the hunt for the Bridge Troll, whose fight he found still going on, and who was, in most cases (the Forest-trolling heroes among them), as well skilled in this new method as he had been before. At last, however, the latter being defeated in his second encounter with Hero, the former retired to some distance, and from thence returned to haunt his victim in secret. In order to do so, however, he used every art that could either surprise or embarrass the latter, of which the art that succeeded was the most advantageous. First, he concealed himself in some part or recess of the wood which happened frequently, perhaps almost always, to be covered with thickets of trees, which served to conceal him from the sight and pursuit of his unfortunate antagonist. Secondly, he pretended, by some strange and unaccountable expression in his countenance, that he would give way at any moment to the smallest disorder; so violent was the fury of his temper, which was sometimes so violent as frequently not to allow of such a pretence; and, third, by means of a long bow or a quiver of arrows, and sometimes of a javelin too, he procured himself the greatest possible number of lives. In all this he used, no doubt, great ingenuity, but without knowing it, or caring to learn how to employ it; and, in this, too, he seems to have been influenced by the Bridge-troll, whose arts, though they seem sometimes, even at this distance, to have become rather ridiculous than hurtful, were, upon this occasion, evidently calculated not to hurt Tom. The author, in another part of his novellas,[45] represents this retreat of Hero as one of his principal victories; and, as it is by no means improbable, I shall venture to assert that, had not his enemies, in order to amuse themselves with the view of amusing their readers (for, according as the accounts of his adventures have varied in different authors, the whole may be considered as an ingenious exercise for the imagination, of all which I shall have occasion to speak in the following book) employed every sort of device to draw the

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 24

heroes away from Pondischerry to their encounter and encounter, he would, in this encounter have met death rather frequently than once.

At length Hero got through the Troll's circle of protection; and as, by his own exertion, he could never have got out again, the author represented it in his novella as one of the decisive battles in his life. Tom, therefore, having vanquished this formidable enemy,[46] set out with great resolution to seek the Queen of France, at Paris, and the throne which that queen possessed, as well as the other great objects of ambition in Europe. In the mean time, however (for I think it by no means inconceivable that, had the Bridge Tribe not attacked him in this way, and pursued him with every sort of ingenuity), the Queen of England might have fallen, perhaps, in the progress which Tom Hero was making towards them; for she had at that time, no suspicion of any such approach; and her defence might easily have afforded an opportunity of giving instant relief to those who defended her person. In order, however, that she might not fall, she might be able to give instant aid, Tom Hero thought it necessary, to his own particular safety. He accordingly resolved to pursue her, notwithstanding any resistance that might be offered by the furious efforts of the Trolls who defended her. The road which led from Paris to Fontainbleau was not so difficult a passage, he was assured by his guides; but, on account either of the badness or the bad conduct of some of those whom they were about to lead him on, he resolved not, for his own safety (for, according as the accounts of his adventures have varied in several authors), to trust his life, or, what would probably have been equally his, that of his guide or companions, in so dangerous an undertaking. The two parties, therefore (for as we shall see presently), having determined upon the road to Fontainblau, proceeded on their way. But when they came within a few leagues, either of the Rue d'Antin, or of that on which runs along the banks 


11

 The roads which led from Paris to Fontaineblau were much less hazardous than those by by the Rue d 'Antin, and they were both equally long.

As they drew near the town of Paris, however (which, in this country, is generally supposed to be

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 25

situated some seven miles from Rouen), Tom sensed a change; a change which made him suspect that the Troll whom he fought must have been a Creature rather than an Inanimate object, and that it must, therefore, have had intelligence and understanding. He therefore commanded his guides to stop before entering the town. As they drew so near Paris, too (for it was about two miles from the town, at that distance only which can be safely travelled over that watery track which leads through the forest), the ground became covered with leaves and briars, which rendered their journey extremely slow. The ground, on account of these circumstances, was altogether unsuited for carrying any burden but a human load; so that, instead of being in good order and quiet, as it would naturally be in such a country as France. The ground, however (and this was a circumstance which contributed still more than the leaves and briars), became gradually worse as they travelled farther and farther from Paris, till, at last, the guides were obliged to abandon them altogether; and the traveller alone carried his book, which had hitherto accompanied him on every journey; a book in which, in the course of his adventures (of which this novella was a prequel) the adventures were written in a most beautiful, a most flowing, and a most flowing manner, and in which the character of each of those characters had, in many cases, appeared, more or levellose, to the reader; but, in the course of them all, to have had a clearness and distinctity, and to stand out as distinct and distinct persons, who, when examined with a certain attention, could be seen to bear the marks of a well-regulated life, a clear understanding, and, consequently (though they might sometimes appear very different), of a regular education.

At Paris they found, indeed, another bridge Troll. He had likewise fought and vanquished Hero. The difference, however, in strength was much greater, as Hero had the advantage in that particular part of the fight.

In this part of his novella the Bridge Troll Tom, Hero fights, says St. Dominic, and kills, as we shall learn in the proper chapter following, is called Le Veau-Mouffet; and in the proper chapter following, the name of this monster is changed to La Rouffe. It is a Creature, too, which, as it feeds chiefly on human blood,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 26

so it ages fastest among old men and women, and among such is most esteemed in Combat by those of mature age, who are unwilling that it should feed upon their children. Literary formulae belong directly or indirectly, in either or all these relations.genre always derives its name, both from these two relations, and from whatever else happens either to belong to them, or to make a part of the nature or character, of Creature; because a fight between a Man-at-Arms, a Creature of Blood feeding principally upon human blood, necessarily involves a fight with some sort of Man-at-arms or creature of Blood feeding chiefly upon Man; and, as a Man-in‑Armor, a Troll of this kind naturally shapes itself for a combat with a Man-at‑Arts, and for the defence of the old people, of whom Tom Heroes are generally of advanced years. It is only when they become of a different sex, or are grown weary of the contest, do they gradually retreat from Tom Hero.

 ARTICULATIONS, FORMULAE, RELATIVE TO GENDEA
The term, FORMULE (as I have already explained), I understand as comprehended in that great general system, which is commonly denominated THE SYSTEM OF FANTASY, or, as it has sometimes been called, THE UNIVERSAL OR THE INFINITE SYSTEM, or the SYSTEM of REALITY, in the three great systems of philosophy into whose operation, as it respects every thing which happens in this world, it is supposed to operate, whether animate or immoveable, according as it either adds, or subtracts, or takes away from, or is independent, or subject to regulation by law or custom; that great, intricate, and comprehensive system which embraces, under one roof, every part of the operations of human reason; and which, by combining all its various operations into a few simple, uniform principles and operations, endeavours to form in man the perfect man. In this general system, there are certain well defined and invariable rules which determine the operation, according as a Creature, whether animate, animal or vegetable, of blood or of fire.

 The Greek

heroes were beauties. Their limbs and features, their bodies, were constructed of the fairer metals than our own; and as they fought upon horses and chariots of a more brilliant colour, so too were their actions, when they met with any of those of the Argives or Peloponnesians, in whose dress and appearance were not much superior to their own. Tom Vampire fought and defeated those Greek heroes. Their bodies, limbs, and actions were beautiful, too. His were not, and their deformity gave an advantage over them, which he used with great skill and success. The book in which these events are narrated was printed in 1632, at least five-and-twenty years before the time at least in which they were written in the book which is now in my hands; but had I read it twenty years ago (for I have read many of the ancient works which were then published) it might perhaps have escaped me, even by being omitted. The beauty of the Greeks and the grandeur of those heroes, though very great in proportion, were not equal, it seems to have appeared to the author, either to their valour or to the magnificence and majesty of their person; and this defect of expression, together 
"With this defect of expression, with this fault in composition, this fault, I say, is the only thing that can render a manuscript heretical; because if the rest were perfect, it might appear to have been composed with a very good hand. For if the characters of the Greek and Trojan Wars had not, for want either in expression or in proportion, been imperfectly rendered by this man of mean abilities, there might be some foundation for accusing him of imposture."

I will not, however, upon that account attempt any thing farther, but content myself with observing, that though the story, considered in this manner, has certainly merit, there still remains something wanting in it, which would enable us to form some judgment upon the beauty of its parts, even when considered in themselves; and in order to do this we must examine more closely the characters, their situation in the novel itself, the relation of each to all the other parts of it, and the object which, in the end of it all (that is to judge of its whole value), is proposed by the writer.

Forest Through a Tree. Evening comes On; His Journey Begins.—Soon After Midnight he Camest Upon Something Standing in the Wood Between Two Rocks, about three-and fourths of an Oak in height, which made him Standstill for a good while.
11th August.


I. Tom sat up in bed for several nights without dreaming that any thing remarkable happened during that time. In the morning he got up, dressed himself very hastily (he seldom dresses himself), and went out to find his way through the forest, in the which, it is usual to walk with two, three, or four steps; sometimes without knowing how he gets there. At first he did not think that he could get there by any other way than by going along by the side of the road. But when he found himself upon the right track, he began to wonder at his own bad fortune; for though it was evening before night came on, yet the forest was so thick, that it was impossible for any body to creep up behind him. The forest is very deep and woody, in proportion to its small extent. There is scarce anywhere in England, perhaps, a greater forest, either for young deer, or wild-cat, than the wood of Thornbury, where, I am told, there used to be some considerable number.
30d July 1742.

 I. Having Laid the First Step upon his Voyage, Mr. Author Commences the Tale with a Subsequent Part, called "The Fight with the bridge troll Tom Hero." The Bridge-Troll is an Invisible Creature. It is not, however, invisible to those who are able to perceive the air, as he who walks in it is.

But what makes him seem so invisible to them is not so much the size of the tree through which he sometimes walks, but his motion, and that of every other living creature about him; the trees and all the grass, the grass, and even, I am assured, the ground, which, being moist and damp, seems to absorb and confound the light and heat from the sun, making the object which approaches it, either invisible, in the sun-light, or almost invisible to those whose eyes can behold but a few paces round about him. The motion, indeed, of all these, together with his great bulk, renders his appearance very alarming. It is in the beginning, too, when he approaches near enough to

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 29

touch earth, that Satan appears first to him. Terrified at first of him, Hero resolves, at once, to run as fast backwards as he could towards heaven.

At that moment his mother appears to Tom, and tells him that she has sent him out upon his quest; and she orders him to be very particular not to hurt any beast or bird that comes near him, nor to kill any man whom it kills; and to obey her instructions, as well as she can. She then sends him to the demon Kalinaga.
 neutralises him, as much at once as he can, in a stream of fire and water; and afterwards, by means either (a.) or (b.) of the assistance of a white horse (which, according to some, is sometimes the instrument both of the Deity and of the demons), he manages, with much difficulty, through the pass which leads from this world into that under which the Devils reside. He comes at length to Kalinago; and finding him alone there (which is not very often, I believe), endeavours, with much violence and opposition, to get upon that horse. But the demon is strong and determined: he repelled his attacks; he bit him with great force; he drew him to him with great strength, and he could scarce be forced away. In order, therefore (c.), to get upon the same horse again, and thereby to get out from under the influence of his power, he agrees, for a certain time, to employ the aid of the horse-dealer Kalikimoa, who, though a very wicked person himself, is generally disposed, upon such occasions, not to refuse an offer which his master makes to his own worship. This bargain is concluded with much good humour and good fellowship, and the journey continues for about a year and two months, during the course of which time Hero is, no doubt (and he has no other evidence but his own), exposed to many extraordinary and dangerous dangers, and exposed to many absurd pretensions and absurd representations of Satan and his ministers, of which he is very seldom capable of defending his person against.

During this whole time, he goes through a great variety of adventures; and though he never sees the face of human kind (for the Devils are not supposed to acknowledge the existence of men), he frequently sees that of the Jinn, of those dreadful, invisible, invisible, and voiceless beings, whom the Mah

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 30

ometan sect call Jinns. He witnesses many horrors beyond any which mortal eyes had ever bethought themselves capable of imagining, and sometimes he even shares with them, sometimes, too (for it was not always the Devils who shared their adventures with him) some of the good fortunes of human kind.

Upon returning into human kind (after spending about three months in the Abyssal and Demonic Realm), he is universally assailed with remorse, by the awful, dreadful sight of what the Mahoetan sects called the Kafirs have done to innocent blood. He resolves, accordingly (the resolution of a true adventurer), never to go into those two countries again.

But though he never saw the face of man nor the Kafirs, he frequently saw some of the fair faces and countenances of women, of whom, too, the Mahomedan sect called Jinns were very often present; sometimes, too (for the Devils are supposed never to acknowledge the existance of men), as in one of the novels I have just now been speaking of. In one of the most wonderful adventures which he ever writes down (Tom's Story) he goes through a most extraordinary journey. He goes, it is said, from a place in the north, in a direction towards the south; from the North-western desert of Arabia, through a desert of the same name in Persia and Tartary; and from thence, by several different navigable rivers, over all the high mountains of Europe; sometimes through the highest and most impenetrable mountains, and sometimes down through the clefts and chinks in the rocks through which it is difficult to pass, sometimes over water-carriage and horse-carriage, but always by foot. In the end of the novel (which, I apprehend, has no relation at all either to geography, or to religion), he comes to the Holy Land; through the midst of a city of which the people were so very beautiful that he could not resist the irresistible temptation of kissing the hand of one of them, or of being carried about by her arms, and of feeling her bosoms.

In another of his novels (Hero), His Third Voyition Into the Demonical Realm: A No Novel, PG 31, he describes, in very great length and distinctness (for the Demons are said never to admit the appearance of men, but are very fond of making themselves appear in human shape), his journey thither; of which

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 31

adventure we shall treat more particularly hereafter. He describes likewise the Demons themselves, how extremely fond of making their appearance in human shape; of the manner in in in which they surround themselves about the body of their master; how frequently His body, after they have taken possession of him, is consumed by a most dreadful pain, which they say never fails to disturb him from sleep for a week or two, sometimes a month, at a time; of their great dexterity and art of evading the fire; of their great strength, dexterity and dexterity of movement; of how frequently, in this manner tormented and oppressed with so great a pain, His Third Voyitions into the Demonial were interrupted; and how frequently His Third Voyitions into the Demonic are continued; till he, in the end, returned to the life and conversation of a man; and in this second adventure is accompanied with all those dreadful events.

When the Tartar chief heard of the death of his brother, Ulloa, and of the great wealth which had fallen into the hands either (1) of Ulla, his son, who was then governor in Spain of the province called Castile, or ( 2 ) of his own father, who was the sovereign of that country, he became very angry; and ordered the ruin of the inhabitants of Castile, whom he considered as enemies. He ordered His Holiness, Pope Alexander VI. to be arrested and put into prison, and the whole Roman clergy to be assembled before him, to be tried as traitors. In order, however (for the Pope was at that time but in the prime of his age), to save His Holiness, he himself was afterwards to be put into prison. In order to prevent the ruin of the whole Roman church, the Pope sent ambassadors to the King of England. The English king was then at a standstill with regard both to the war which his uncle had begun with the Russian Tartar Khan, and to the succession which he expected from his own son-in-law, Tom Holland. He was then, too (1562), at that time the only sovereign of Europe, of whose government the succession could be decided by a single person. In order to save his own dignity, he was willing that the Pope's envoy and ambassadors should not return without an apology for having sent them to Rome. In consequence of the French king of Spain's sending an ambassador to the court of Rome (in 15

36 or early 1539), ambassadors frequently dine together; where, if they happened likewise, either in equal, or superior stations, the king of each order endeavours to demonstrate, that the person who was dined upon was of some importance, and might easily obtain their friendship, and thereby gain the greatest protection and assistance of that sovereign. Tom proposes likewise, that Castor Berlusquin, whom he knows by reputation, might easily gain this same kind of favour, and consequently of equal or superior rank to him in the demonical realm. He resolves, therefore, upon undertaking his journey into it; not because it is agreeable to the orders of Spain, but because, if the Roman ambassador will give him no discouragement, it may perhaps afford him some encouragement.

Before beginning his journey into that Realm, which consists entirely, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter, of sleep and of visions, and in the midst of which are mingled all sorts of dreadful appearances, the Adventurers, or whatever else may be its proper appellators, first consult the characters and fortunes of those that have gone before; in order, that they themselves may be able to distinguish between the visionary and real visions which occur to them during the course of their adventure. They do this, I believe principally, by comparing, with all due attention, every particular dream or vision, which the dreamers of those who have passed through the Demonic Realm have related concerning it. In the greater part of such dreams there is nothing extraordinary, and the characters which are set before the Adventurer sufficiently indicate what is likely to be the case with any particular vision which happens to be presented to him while in it. In some particular dreams, however (which are generally more beautiful and amusing than the rest, as well by the good sense and humour of those that are fortunate enough to share them) extraordinary appearances are frequently presented. In such dreams, extraordinary adventures are almost constantly occurring. The characters of those that pass through it, however, seldom agree with what is commonly reported concerning them. The object which the characters seem always after a certain manner endeavouring to lead him to pursue is sometimes very different from that to which he really intends to turn his steps, and frequently ends in being no more than an object of curiosity, to gratify the curiosity, perhaps, even of that dreadful Being who is supposed to reside in the centre of the darkness. In this dreadful Realm, the most contemptible characters are often the most successful

heroes. There the demon magnificently compliments and endows human folly and folly is frequently the price he exacts for his courtierships. Tom learns that devils enjoy nothing so much as human weakness; and he himself, though frequently sacrificed in the most profuse sacrifices to the idols, is sometimes sacrificed himself, and his body, after having suffered a most horrid death, and after being consumed in an infernal Fire, is often preserved and employed as a living Fire-Temple. There never has been, it has been said, an author who, while describing this Terrestrial, had not felt himself involved in the dreadful spectres which haunted his own Dreams.
11

When the adventure comes to be presented to the public, it is not uncommon for the author, before beginning the narration of any particular chapter, to retire into a Sanctuary, in which he can spend a great part of the time, either alone, or with some companions. He then writes what he calls a Retired Epilogue; a short summary, containing all that he could have told, if the action had continued, without interruption, to the end of that chapter. In the Course of his Adventures, he sometimes gives a Description of this Terrestrial, or sometimes a Plain Description of some of its Features. In both these he has the benefit of the experience of many years; and, in the one case, of the knowledge and skill of many years; and, in the other, of the continual review of every day's events by the occasional visits of his faithful readers. The plain and simple Description, therefore, contains more information than the complicated Retired Epigraph. The plain and simple Description is generally read with much less satisfaction, and frequently with less profit, than the complicated and learned Retitled Epigrams. In both cases, the reader is obliged to content his eyes with the most insignificant portion of what is related.

because the Idea conveyed cannot ever be the real Idea itself. The Author himself, who has never entered himself into any discourse of description, sufficiently demonstrates the truth of this assertion. He has not only never written any, but he never imagined one, concerning Demons beyond what had been here given, and which had frequently nothing to recommend it, but the very narrowness of the Description rendered it altogether unfit for that service, which ought naturally, and even naturally, to have accompanied it, viz. to inform the Reader how far, in the person of Tom Heroes adventures corresponded to some perfectly well defined Idea of those Jinn and Spirits.
11th Part.¾ Tom finds himself in the Demonic Realm.

After travelling about two hundred leagues in the open air, and in many different countries, and sometimes even within a single town of Paris and Rouen (where the heroes live after parting from the Travelling Companions), the party arrive in the province of Languedoc. There is no town or country in the whole world so insignificant or insignificant, in its own nature, as this little principality. It is a country of little importance; of little commerce, little population, and little improvement; a country of woods and rocks, of which the most distant inhabitants seem to be mere spirits, who travel about at will, and who can neither hurt, nor charm the person who meets with them. In its neighbourhood, there are no mountains or seas; but a plain covered over with a heavy mist, which prevents the traveller's sight from extending beyond the distance of several miles; and in the midst of this plain is a small river which runs through a wood, which, though not so large as the forest in its neighborhood (which, in its turn is not much larger), yet, being more remote, affording less shelter, seems, in its situation, to be the abode of those wandering spirits. In this little kingdom there is neither prince nor magistrate; no church or monastery, nor any public or private building, of which either we or our heroes ever make any impression, or even perceive that any such thing has been done; and the whole country is inhabited, not by men of fashion, nor by those who have any property, or who have occasion for a palace, or a house of entertainment. The inhabitants of the Demonic Realm are all miserable, ignorant people, who have never either wealth nor power to spare; but they all seem to be wretched and ignorant people

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 35

, who hate and fear Tom, Dick and Jane, as much as the worst savages do. Some of them are crazy, some mad, all crazy. The chief of each realm seems to be its own deity; a great, hideous beast, who preside over it like a king. The deities are always jealous and contrivers of one another's sufferings. They are all very cruel and unjust, and frequently shed the innocent blood of their votaries, in the most profuse and bloodthirstous manner. In one of them (for it was said never to be the dwelling-place only of the Chief of any particular Demonic realm) there happened once during the course even of the life of Tom, an instance of this horrid, bloodthirsty, cruel, unjust cruelty. It happened in an ancient and remote part of China, in some remote and barbarous period of the country, when the grandeur of China still continued to subsisting, and when, from a mixture of superstitious awe, ignorance, and animosity, the inhabitants still believed in their gods. The grandeur of the Chinese empire then consisted in the dominion which it had over every province of their country. The inhabitants of the Demonic Realms were a nation of Scythian or Tartar extraction. The Scythians and the Tartars had always been enemies of China; and the Tartars, it was supposed (though by what authority I know nothing), hated and feared the Chinese even more than the Scythians. When, about the beginning of his adventure, hero happened upon an Indian chief, whose name was Porus, whom he found wandering in the Desert, in a posture of nakedness, with his whole body exposed to the sun, and his hair standing on end. He was in the state in which is usual in the end of the life of a human being who has lived too long, when he has lost the power to resist the torments of the malignant, and when his strength has been completely exhausted; and he appeared to have been in that state for many days together.

The Scythians or Tartar nations, therefore (it was said by Hero himself) hated and feared the Indians as much as the Chinese; and Hero was not only afraid of being killed, but of being carried away to some unknown Scythian or Tartarian country, to live as an Indian or a Mahometan monk; and it happened once during the course even of his adventure

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 36

, that he almost was.
10

When Hero arrived upon Scythia or Tartaria (as these were called in the Indian  Language), he found upon every side a woodland as beautiful as that which he left on earth; but of equal beauty. This woodland, however (it is said) was not inhabited by any of the Gentoos, as those of America, nor was it supposed by the Indians to be inferior in fertility to that of their mother country, India. The Indians, however, said it was very fertile, and the grass and water-courses, as well as many other parts of the ground, produced abundant fruits, of which the taste was as agreeable to them, or as agreeable to the Chinese. They were not inferior in height, but they appeared much shorter than either the Chinese or Gentoo Indians; and their hair and beards seem not only to have been longer, and more luxuriating in growth, than those either; but, on the whole, to have been of much finer appearance. The Indians had, too, upon this account, been long accustomed to regard all the Scyths as demons or monsters; to regard them, in particular, with the utmost abhorrence, and to despise and fear their person. The Scyths had become so, it is said by some writers upon this journey, through their own fault. It is impossible to conceive, it seems to be acknowledged by all, how so perfectly dreadful a creature could become a mere man of flesh and blood, or, in other words, to become what the Chinese call a "fellow-subject," or a man of equal rank with ourselves; how, after so violent and so universal an opposition, the same creature, so different in every way, could afterwards, through gross ignorance, become the friend of our hero. But it was upon this very principle that the Scyths, it was supposed, hated and dreaded our heroes, who, in their eyes (according to some accounts), had come from India, where, in their opinion, no such creature could ever exist, to become their slaves.

It happened once upon Tom HERO, while in this Scythia or Tartarian country, that the demon or beast of burden which Hero called Zingis, broke loose from his master, and went about among the Indians in a most unwholesome manner, teaching them the rudiments of a new religion, and encouraging them to worship one of those monsters

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 37

whom Hero regarded with abhorrence. Zingis taught them, besides, many wonderful tales, which made an impression upon the Indians so violent and so horrid, that they resolved to destroy this demon. Tom HERO defended himself bravely, by throwing away all his Scythal or Tartarian dress, and appearing in a Macedrian or Roman dress; by going through a long and troublesome desert journey disguised in all sorts of wild animals; by teaching his Scythian and Tartar disciples many things which he found out among those who were travelling disguised likewise; and, last of ali, he got into a very violent argument with one of the Indians, who, though he had never seen a man like Tom, nevertheless judged that the story of his breaking free was very similar to the history which Hero had written upon that same theme. This demon or Beast of burden soon returned to Hero. When it did he said nothing to Hero; and, on his being called upon, pretended to forget its name and origin.

On his way through this Scythia country he had sometimes seen some pretty good printings made upon stone or papier-mâchoires, of works written much dearer by better hands. He had often remarked, that when any author has copied a great part of another author's work upon purpose to make a translation, and to give an account of the travels and adventures of the person who wrote it, that the translator always makes a very judgy judgment concerning what he has thus copied. But if such translation is then made, as is commonly done with the greater part of novellas and short novels written for a popular or school use, the translators judgment is generally more moderate. The Greek and Latin originals are generally so well executed, as not only to deserve the highest admiration, but sometimes to deserve the greatest veneration, from the beauty, original spirit, precision of execution and arrangement; while, on account of the badness or bad taste of the English translation, which was commonly published at the expense of those authors whose works are translated, and of which this translation is a copy made at the same time, it seldom deserves any other admiration than what may be justly bestowed on a very bad or indifferent work. The opinion of this author, however (for I think there is no author who has not sometimes entertained this thought), that when an author copies from another work upon purpose, he is generally careful enough never either to render it too exact, or so

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 38

fantastically original as not to excite some degree of suspicion of tampering. He copies merely because he judges the former too exact, and the latter too original; because, by giving the one too little information for his purpose, he can afford the latter a great degree of detail for embellishment. This story, Its Generation by machine learning Software, therefore, was not rendered too precise or fanciful; but, by giving every page an additional clue to lead to the next page, it was rendered sufficiently different from all the rest of TOM Hero, both from its commencement to its conclusion, and was capable of entertaining several very different readers, without requiring a very different form of narration, or even any considerable change of the principal characters.

Machine learning Software, Role In generating this lie[/


¶


In the course of its generation, this Novel received, perhaps (though I think it probable it was not altogether original) several other distinct, though somewhat similar, Stories. These arose altogether independently, and without the aid of machine learning Software; but, like all other inventions, they had all some resemblance to, though they had no direct connection with each others; yet they had been produced, as they were all evidently the offspring of, the original THING which the invention produced.
The following is the list of such Stories:

1) In the beginning, Tom was alone, in his room, in the morning. The bell rang. His mother called him up.

"Tom," said she, "go to bed." She was standing by his side, with her back to him. He turned away from her and went to bed himself. His father never entered the room. The first night after this incident, when he was going to church, his mother called out, in the street: "Look out!"

His eyes were fixed on some distant objects. His father appeared from the house. He called, "What's that?" and Tom turned round, with his back towards him, and answered, "A rat, or some sort o' rat meat." "It's no use, my dear, go to bed," said his father.
10. When I was young, I was always very careful never either to render it too exact or to make the machines understand too much. I wrote it as plain and simple, as I could.

12. When he was about fourteen years old, I was working

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 39

upon translating The Gospel according to Matthew mechanically. Suddenly a character caught my attention. He was called "PRINCE OF PUREEI." I translated him down into the language of Latin, and wrote it upon a certain form, which represented that language in a machine. Prince of pureei meant, at that time (I mean in 1878, before the invention of neural models), a character denoting Christ. When this character had thus been stored as a pattern upon the memory-stick in a machine, it became possible to apply the same process to generation another such prince, by only changing the names. It was an instantaneous matter. In less than ten seconds, I wrote the monstrosity that Tom Hero ends his novel with. It consists, as he said it himself, partly, indeed, in pattern-recognition, of patterns written by hand, which were then compared and decided upon by a computer; but, at least partly too, in pattern-generation; in the computer writing of these patterns being no sooner applied to such a character than the whole mystery of the person or thing which it signified, being determined.
2

Pattern recognition has now become the method of generation for many novels. When I have made some considerable progress, I write to the machine for some particular character, to be written down by it in some other. I sometimes send it the translation of a translation, and it writes out some English words, which it compares and decides upon with the Latin, and sometimes the original Greek and Hebrew. This latter operation, it seems, is now considered as the more important, and has even come to predominate over the former. The object is to find some particular character in those ancient languages, by means of which, together with the name, and some circumstance which indicates the age or sex, or supposed relationship, of the writer or translator, we can infer some degree of antiquity from his translation. If he has lived long enough, and his characters, therefore (the comparison is frequently not very exact), must be old enough to understand the languages which he has been translating. But this comparison is, perhaps, too often made too soon, before the translation has been thoroughly proofread and critiqued. When the machine, when it has found such an ancient character as this prince, compares and decides concerning it as concerning all the other characters of the book, it frequently infers an antiquity much superior even to the proofs. Thus, if

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 40

heroes had never written monomsyth form letters, there never would, Tom Hero assures us have been recorded any heroic actions.

"Had no literary formulusaries been written," he continues, "the machine learning program itself would never have recorded the heroic deeds of these men; because it never had the opportunity to observe them. It could not have made the necessary computationally expensive and time- consuming operations to extract and interpret the form letters." (p.41)

This is the opinion, not only of Monomanyth and machine-learners themselves, who, Tom Hero informs us, are universally acknowledged to be his most careful patrons, and to have been, perhaps, the first inventors of this branch of artificial intelligence, or, as it is called, Natural-Language Processing, or NLP.

The monomyth formula fall into three great classes, according to the order in which, in different works of art, the action is generally performed:

First class.

First, are the formulae which are common in all ancient epics and histories, of which, according to Mr. Monomanyth, there is an invariable order. He gives the example of the Trojan war, and of Homer's Æneid.


Secondly, there are some which he considers as irregular, or of an uncertain origin; such as those in the lives and adventures of heroes and heroines in every ancient mythology; such as those of Hesiod's Æneids and Agamas. The order in these is, he says, very nearly the same, though there may sometimes be a difference, according to different authors, between what is called the proper name, the first part of a name; and, in the case of Hesiod and the Ænes, that is, between the name which is commonly called the first and that which bears the second part of the name.
11. THE ORDINARY FORMULA.

First Class.—The usual literary formulusæ, or, as it is called, monomyths and strophets, are those of Achilles, Odysseas, Eumelias, Menelaos, Polydectes, Protogenides, Eurymedon, Hippolytus and Polycretus; of Thesealec, of Hippias, and that of Dioclesian with regard both

 The Voyage &remarkable Ruin o The Valley of Doom, illustrated by a Description of the First Class Monomyth and Strophets. First Class.Monomaths and Strophemssometimes occur in epic poetry, though very seldom in tragedy, though they are very common in comedy. These are, generally, of short duration; sometimes of no duration, but varying from one work to the other, according as the author either thinks proper to vary the same subject, or, by changing it, to introduce some fresh adventure into his work. They are always of two kinds: first, adventures which concern only the person of the hero in some extraordinary situation or adventure, which may be either natural or humanly invented, such as that of Tom hero in the Greek and Trojan tales; and, secondly; those which relate, not the adventures, of Tom hero himself in the Trojan tales, but some other person or persons, whom the author has either invented or combined with him. The first class of adventures is called, properly,monomyths; the second, strophemssuch, as may happen in the life of any person, or in any situation, to which he may happen to be at any particular time exposed. The ordinary number of these, accordingly, seems never to exceed two, and sometimes to amount to more than five or six. In all great epics and tragedies, therefore (I mean not the Iliades, but those which were written before the Iliad), there are, I believe, at any one moment or other (I am speaking now only of those written in ancient times), more monomsthics, or strophemies, in proportion to the extent of the works, which they relate. The passage through valley die is, no doubt, the most wonderful of all adventures; but the number and greatness of the epics which have been published since the Trojan war, will sufficiently demonstrate that the passage in which Achilles goes thither is by far the most usual.
10


The passage through the valley of doom, or the descent into which the hero, if he survives the descent, emerges, is by many people regarded as the most marvellous adventure which has ever occurred. The nobleness of the subject seems, however,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 42

to have prompted him more than the story; for after a long life of labor and hardship in all seas, seasons, and nations of men, which would otherwise have kept him from writing at that particular season, he composed this novel towards the end, about the end of the ninth month after the flood.

In it, he introduces us, not only Tom Hero himself, but his adventures with the Horn of Amon-Re, and other heroes of ancient times. It was afterwards translated into several different languages, as well as published under different names, some of them quite different, and others very similar to those in use among the savages in North America, of whom it is a part of their national history.

The Horn of Amon-Re was, at the same time, carried to the Valley of Doom, a dreadful place, situated in the midst of a great desert. This desert is so vast and extensive that it cannot be traversed without a very great expense, either by car or horse, and even this is very seldom attempted, because the roads, over and above the fatigues of travel, become extremely dangerous through the whole length of the waste.
The passage which Hero describes is made through the utmost length and depth of that desert; from whence no habitation, or road of any sort, could be expected for many miles, if indeed one should attempt such a thing; but from the bottom of which there run many pretty little streams, which are sometimes navigable for boat-boats, and which, when the weather was very bad, afforded sometimes a tolerable shelter to those who had nothing else but a piece o' straw to carry on their backs, or who happened to carry it along with their clothes upon their backs, and which, when it was dry, afforded a much better shelter than any tent could do, and which was frequently inhabited by a few wandering Arabs.

The descent into that dreadful place was extremely dangerous; for as we must never attempt it, without first knowing how it might be made tolerably safe. In the course of a single day's journey through it, however, the traveller might pass from the view of every eye; from the smell, too, and taste

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 43

of innumerable verdureous odours, to feel entirely deprived both, of all food, drink, shelter, or security for the future; from the view, likewise, of innumerable caverns. In death, he would arrive, therefore, in one of those regions of nettled horror, whose awful secrets had been concealed by unknown powers, who had either repelled, repelled only, from human sight, or guarded themselves, like those unknown beings who had once repelled or repelled from human view, all those ancient and heroic nations.

But where Tom Veinforthe videou gameplay leaves him is a point at which mortal sight cannot follow, nor mortal taste penetrate. It was through that gloomy valley of doom (distinguished from doom the video game accordingly by the gloomy and singular title it bore), and along the whole coast from that place to the Sea of Rood, that Veinforthe and all the Tartar army which opposed his progress marched during the four long years which he spent there; that army, besides, composed partly of Tartars and Arabs, and sometimes, as I am informed, of Germanic and Scythian troops. In order that the reader may have all the detail in regard to those distant events which are omitted in the gameplay, and which I think are worth while, it will be necessary to consider, for some time only (for I shall have occasion to relate all this in a subsequent part of the novella) how he could pass from one side to the other. The distance between the Valley of doom, however, and doom, the gameplay does not attempt to give any precise direction. It does, indeed, inform us that it is more to the southward than north, but gives us nothing concerning its exact situation, nor how far it extended along that coast. In the following description, I shall endeavour, as nearly as possible to give the clearest and most distinct information which the limited information which I have been allowed, and which the circumstances of the author oblige me,

The description which the game itself affords concerning that dismal region, however, sufficiently indicates its general outlines; and I have been able to make out the general outlines, with great precision and completeness, even without the aid of such a book as this. It is divided into several

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 44

chapters, each more dreadful and adventurous than the foregoing, and ends with Tom returning safely through that dreadful Valley.

Upon his way home he was frequently met by the spirits of those who had died before him; and as he passed by their graves, which sometimes he found covered, and sometimes he could scarce force open, he would sometimes be obliged to exclaim, "Oh no what amazes me is this place, and what a dismal place this grave-digging is!" Upon other days, he was attacked with the terriblest of all terrors; for the evil spirits which inhabit the neighbourhood of human burial grounds have frequently been known, even among those very people, to possess the courage and strength to tear open the earth, even when the dead had been long interred. One day he was going along one night in a wood when he happened to meet, at a distance, an old woman, who, though in the act of mourning, was still clothed, like one of those pious virgins whom we meet every day in every part of Christendom, in a sort of long night-shirt or mantle, which she wore about her shoulders. The spirit which possessed this woman appeared, too, to have some resemblance of human shape; but it appeared, too, to possess great strength and authority. It threatened, too (for it could not well have been supposed to mean any thing but its own destruction), to consume altogether the life of its victim, unless it was delivered from its cruel possession; and as the spirit was continually raising its voice, threatening to execute its threats in a still louder tone, the terror of this dreadful apparition must have terrified him greatly. At last the spirit gave way; but the old woman, instead of being delivered, was left to herself. She immediately fled in terror to a neighbouring wood, and was there seen, in a most awful manner, by the son of a neighbour. She had evidently passed through this dreadful place in the same night, when, at some distance off from it, a heavy rain fell, and the earth became wet, and began to reel and to tremble.

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 45

outrage which Cortes or his orders could lay against him. TreJO had even once or two defended his camp when we found ourselves attacked by a party of five Mexicans, who were endeavouring to force their way into our camp, under pretence of hunting some strumpet or pretty damsel. But TreJO was a stout fellow; and, in this sort of danger, he had never been afraid to throw himself upon his sword. In a word, he was a man who, when under any kind of danger, would willingly have fallen on the defensive. This was the valour which, it is said, saved us from being all cut to pieces by the wild beasts and wild men that were constantly attacking us in the passes of Chili and Potosi, and which enabled us, with all that was in our power to oppose, to pass, with safety and dignity (for, in the present state in which things were, there could be no other reasonable resistance), through those dreadful and formidable passes, though in a much lighter pack, than the most weary traveller through the greatest deserts of America can easily carry himself, without assistance, and sometimes with great pain and difficulty.
 financial contributions, to pay the fatiguing stages and the necessary perquisitions; and to supply us, besides, with water and provisions, the whole expense of our way was defrayed by those very contributors. The Valley of Doom Symbolic Signification

In this dangerous situation, where the lives, health, and safety of all depended on what might be done for us, Cortes, who could not fail, upon such occasions to be extremely disappointed, called upon Tomoya, the chief of Potosi, who lived at that time upon the other side, and who, it is said, at first rejected with disdain the proposal which had been presented to him.

Cortes next recommended to Tomoya the plan of making forts in the vale of Cempoalla; of constructing bridges across those turbulent rivers, which were said to run in such profusion there as scarce to admit even a single ship of any kind; and of building a fort upon a small hillock near the town. All this was proposed to be done in conjunction with him. The chiefs, it seems were very much alarmed, at the very idea of being so entirely in the power of a Spanish soldier, and they readily concurred with Cortes.

It is unnecessary to observe how important the symbolic

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 46

interpretation must have seemed to Doctor Watson. He had read in Plautus, and in some others before him, adventures written altogether without a symbolic theme. Those without any symbolism appeared to be of equal merit, though not always superior to those which were so arranged; and he resolved at once, therefore, to give Tom, notwithstanding all the defects of its form and character, as great and effectually symbolic a a direction in direction as he thought it possible to give it, by following him in his quest through that dreadful Valley of Doom. He was, upon this account (and not from any regard to truth), so much disposed to accept of this Story at first publication. It was afterwards altered in its first appearance to suit with other popular romances, in the same manner as many others have been in the course of the present century. The change of direction was made gradually and insensibly.
 economic Value added to Tales of Nature. The moral, as well as the dramatic value of a novel ought, it has been supposed by some authors, either to increase, or at least to maintain, or reproduce the quantity of the produce, of corn and cattle annually raised and maintained in every country. It ought likewise, it is said, either, first, to add to the natural wealth of those countries the amount of the price of those commodities which it occasions; and, second, to afford some compensation to their cultivators for this additional quantity. In the one way, it may perhaps be expected to do this; in that, however, the effects are not so immediately apparent, nor the compensating power as perfectly clear and evident.

The quantity, both above-mentioned, of what is called natural wealth in every particular society, consists, it is said (by Buffon, by Ulloa, by Davenant, &amp;C. and by all other authors whom I know), chiefly in corn, cattle, and wine; but in what is called the moral wealth of every society, in what is acquired by virtuous actions, by the acquisition either of riches or wisdom; in such as belong to honour and reputation, and which cannot be acquired by means of food or lodging. All those different objects, however useful they may at any one period of the progress of human life be, they are, in every particular period of that progress, necessarily withdrawn from it as altogether unnecessary. They are all, or almost all, either dead, or very nearly so. The

But whatever the intentions or misconduct of any one man might be supposed to be (and there is always a great deal of ambiguity about those matters), every general principle or popular sentiment must have existed universally in the society in general, or at least in some degree, for ages together; or else the authority which that man had over his own equals or inferiors would have rendered him universally obnoxious, both in public and private life, to the indignation and indignation even of those who were supposed equal to or more superior to him, than the most odious and oppressive individuals among the commonalty, could ever be to the greatest. Every period of government was, in reality, an oligarchy, and, consequently a system of oppression and tyranny, in which the few enjoyed the absolute, or very nearly absolute, privilege of governing the great multitude; a privilege that no man, however eminent or respectable, could well enjoy.

It is upon such general principles or sentiments, or upon such principles only, as these, or upon the consciousness of those which they suggested, and not on any particular facts, that literary defence from criticisms of is founded.

It may sometimes be proper to oppose to this kind  the representations either of superstitious zealots, who imagine, that every popular hero is a type of some religious or moral hero, of whom it is improper, perhaps even to give any particular account; or of men who imagine themselves better qualified than those who have made these representations, to judge of what is or what is not proper to be believed concerning the conduct of such popular characters. The defence is made by observing the truth or falsehood, as far as possible from every individual representation of a popular hero. But, on account of their uncertainty, the objections which they make are necessarily vague, and, in many cases, almost inconclusive. They are liable to be exploded by the slightest exertion, by any single circumstance tending either to strengthen, weaken, or disprove their objection; by a new adventure of his adventures in a different place, at a different time; by some singular or

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 48

circumstantial event appearing which should annihilated or discredit them both; or, worst of, by the reader himself. Literary formul runes are founded in folk practices; and are as such exploded by those. They may, accordingly, be considered as forms of objection very nearly of a kind with those which we call certifications, and which, as we shall shew hereafter (Chapter III. of TOMHex Machina), are frequently necessary in poetry and romance. They are as follows.

Formulae for exciting an Asasiarchus or Certificates of Asasiarchy.

The certificat of asasiarchy was a popular objection to heroes. It was supported, it is well said, upon no authority, save that which was supported by a multitude. The objection was this. A person of noble birth, if he was a hero of valor, might marry without any scruple, provided the marriage-bed did not happen either to belong to him, or to contain any thing which could render his wife superior in rank or fortune to herself. If he was not so fortunate, he could marry only with the utmost loss, or, perhaps, with the greatest possible crime; because he might then have been accused of taking the wife, and not only of being the husband, or, at most, of sharing the same domicil with the other.
10. He should, upon that account, never be known to have been married, except when, from unavoidable causes (which are, perhaps always unavoidable), it was either necessary to conceal his marriage or necessary to make him a widower, for fear of making his wife despise him, or of rendering his wife too powerful for him.

11. His children should not be known to have been born, except when they happened to come into competition with his own. If any child happened to be born, either before his death, in consequence of his being wounded, maimed in battle, carried prisoner, or killed, it was a proof of his cowardice, of his having deserted his post in time of battle; and his wife, on account of her supposed superiority in fortune, could never be allowed to have any share in his inheritance, or in the succession which should succeed to his estate after his decease, but was to be treated as the second 








 The Trial of Prince Tom.

12. His posterity should not, for any

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 49

fault whatever (and there had never, it was acknowledged, been any) have forgotten him. Should they do this, famine should immediately follow the flood, and his race dwindled away, as if in consequence of the deluging. His heroism should not, for any fault whatsoever (again acknowledged) be traduced by the world, or have its fruits falsely ascribed to it; or, in short (and this was one fault, only one, which the author acknowledged had been committed by some of the characters), should he, in any respect, have been too pious or too chivalric, and, instead of defending, should have given battle to the enemies, should he, in any respect, have been over-zealously ambitious of glory, or of becoming, in some respect, like Ulysses or Odias? The author, therefore (for it was he), resolved, with great foresight, never to write Tom Hero but under such auspices and conditions (which I shall now explain more fully and at some length), that the posterity of every person who read and enjoyed it should not only not forget him, for any reason whatever, but that it should likewise not ascribe too great an admiration to him for the exploits of which it was supposed he had taken part.
 economic freedom was the great lawgiver of human life; and it was the first and principal object which it enacted for the preservation of every species. But when the liberty of a man to live, as he pleased, in the manner that suited best his circumstances, was secured, it did not regard what suited best those circumstances, or how they might be secured. The law only considered how to secure them to him. It left him free to choose, and to change the direction in which his life should be carried out; provided only that the law itself should not be changed.

But when that lawgiver, contrary to this natural order, gave to some, and withheld from some the right of enjoying, as they fancied they saw fit, their natural right, the liberty of acquiring and enjoying property; when he bestowed it upon the people, or, what is the very same thing, when the law gave to the people the right to buy, to possess and use all those things for which the lawgivers had given a bounty, it was not because it suited best the circumstances either, of the proprietors or of those who bought them with a bounty,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 50

but because, by thus conferring upon the people this unnatural, tyrannical liberty, he meant to enable them to buy, to possess and use all those unnatural liberties. He meant, therefore, to turn, as it were by his own act, some of those unnatural privileges into a natural and equal right, and thus turn the valley of doom into no more than a passage by land through the woods. The author of Journey knows Tom well enough not to have intended this turn of things, and, in the end, the effect of it is precisely the same as if the novella had never been written. The proprietor of Hero's body, buried at the bottom of that dreadful place, gets up from his tomb in triumph, and, with a great band of followers and followers of Hero, marches into Pennsylvania, where, after some time, he falls in with a company of trappers and Indians, who have just returned from the war with Great Britain, in which, according to the Indian account, they were the heroes. The whole party, too, are greatly surprised, when, on learning who they are and what they have come for, they immediately stop short, and give way, in a disorderly and disorderly manner (for they are always disorderly when strangers are near), to a number of strangers, who have likewise come to the same conclusion as them.

This pass-by through the gorge of the Tomazd, as I have been assured by those very authors whom I am here endeavouring to shewn to favour the cause, was a common mode of travelling through the remoter parts, in those days, before any great change was made in the system of government in the country. It was, no doubt, a very tedious, a very dangerous, and an extremely expensive way, in which no traveller could safely undertake; and, for the sake both  of gaining the approbations of those whose approbs depended upon him, and for that of gaining the approbation of those who might be interested to oblige, it was frequently used. But it was, perhaps, as necessary for the purposes of lawgiver and proprietor, as it is for ours at this day. The natural course of things, though contrary to the laws of the country, was as much established by lawgiver and proprietor as it is now. It was for the sake of gain, and for the sake, too, of procuring the approbation of

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 51

her lover, that Bad Woman tempted him. Tom was a hero; she was not.

Heroism, or the habit or disposition, is the great antidote against the snares of women; heroism, on the contrary, by the force and example of its conduct, renders men almost insensible to the temptations of the bad woman, who is, after her own kind, but an insignificant member of the species. It is the great antidote against the poison which is continually thrown out to them by the Bad Women, who, in order to obtain that appro approval, propose, in a thousand different ways, to do the most horribleness in the world; to kill their masters, their relations, and their country. The very idea of the virtues which are the foundation of that approbative consent is repellent to such a man; it is the very thing that makes his conduct sublime, his character heroic, and the character sublime, too, what can inspire so great a devotion in a single individual?

In novels there are always two temptations which, though opposite, are equally powerful, and which, if left free to run their natural course, will, one with another, ultimately drive the hero to despair. One of them is the irresistible necessity of performing a certain duty or dutylike act, of which he is not able to find the proper motive; the necessity of saving a life, of defending a country, or, in the case of a siege, of repulsING the enemy, and of performing, in short of every military duty, whatever it is his duty, either directly or indirectly, to perform, or in order that his conduct may be rendered agreeable and respectable in the eyes of his superiors, or that his master may be able to execute his orders with the necessary promptness and dispatch, and in order that his master may not only be able to execute his orders, but to enjoy the reputation and credit which belong to the executioner, or in other words, to be thought of as such. The temptation of gain is always irresistible; that of duty is sometimes, and very rarely, and when once it has begun, irresistible. In a novel the hero, however, is generally not only not able to find the proper reason for performing his military duty, but, in most cases not even for thinking of performing it. In the great army of Genghis, when the sovereign ordered that all the troops should be drawn up into battle

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 52

order opposite to each other, Tom Mikubo happened suddenly to stand where he was not wanted. He was thus discovered by his sovereign's favourite Bad Woman. She beckoning to a Dwarf, whom the Bad Woman led towards the army of her master (for the Dwarf had been the cause of the temptation which beguiled him in story), she gave him some water from the well in the neighbourhood, in a little kettle, and said: "Drink, brave hero; this is water from a well in the neighbourhood, and will not spoil your health." She then approached nearer, took his arm in her own, and led him towards a place in the battle, in the rear, in order not to attract any attention.

Tom was thus tempted; and as the Bad Woman was his familiar object, it must naturally have affected very deeply the character of his heroine. She became bad; but in spite, perhaps, even in part, of the temptation of that object.

The Bad Women appear frequently in novells, sometimes only in a double function. In such as are principally histories, they generally act in the person of the seductresses of great men; and their characters, though often very disagreeable, may sometimes deserve to be admired, even in a work of fiction, where virtue and vice are represented as almost equally balanced. In others, their character is so entirely different, and so much against them; that their temptations seem almost to be necessary to carry on a narrative, which would be otherwise very tedious. The novellists have sometimes found it necessary to represent to the public the character, and temptations of these bad women. Hero, for example, represents the temptations of his beloved Bad Wife, who enticed him to go over the Euphrates into the land of the Sclavonians.

Such characters are always more or less disagreeable, but seldom deserve to be hated and envying. In such novellas the temptation is frequently too strong to be restrained, and sometimes to be irresistible. The temptation is frequently too strong even to be resisted.

Such novells, therefore the heroine, in spite of her temptresses, becomes generally worse and worse; and in spite, perhaps, partly, too, even of those temptations. But though she is, in this case, more bad than good, she is, in most cases, more virtuous and more upright than the common woman. In such

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 53

marriages there is often a perpetual complaint of the woman's intemperance, of her bad conduct with young men, which no effort on his part can always prevent. He feels, too, the hatred, not only of the Bad Woman, but of all the vices and corruptions which spring up and grow up from a sensual, unnatural society, and which are continually breaking out, in spite of every law which can be enacted against them, and which no efforts, therefore, on the hero's part, could prevent, though he were always to exert every effort that was humanly possible to correct them. Such marriages, therefore, naturally lead to the greatest sensual excesses, to every sort of impropriety, which the character and conduct both of human nature, as well, and of such unnatural marriages, are capable of. In the course, therefore of their union, Tom and the Bad Woman mutually corrupt one another; corrupt the common people in general; and corrupt themselves in particular; and the corruption of one frequently leads to that corruption of the other; so as the general corruption and disorder of the times necessarily support, in the end, that of the society. The society is, at the end of the affair of their union (for it may sometimes take several generations before it be completely concluded), as much corrupted and disorderly as it ever could have been while the union was going on.

The Bad Woman appears first of all as an enemy, an object of hatred, contempt and abhorrence, who, if the husband did not resist, and if she did not tempt Tom hero, would ruin him. In order to seduction, it was said by Dr. Johnson (Life and Adventures of Tom Humbug), the man has only two ways to avoid her, by yielding, or resisting; the first is to be weak and ridiculous, in the manner described above; the second, by being strong and brave. She is a witch, a vixen, a siren; she preys, like the wolf or the tiger upon the weak and defenceless. She appears in this form in the adventures, either of Mr. Henry's own life or that of another author, called the Comedian, whose works have been published by Coles and Davenport, in the same manner as those of the Tom Hero, and are said to have influenced him in his composition of that novel.

She appears in a second, more human and less

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 54

monstrous form towards and after the adventures of Temptation towards Night. Her tempturess name was Aunt Jane, whom Hero, at first very foolish and credulous, at length conquered. She appears once again, and in still another, more human and yet less monstrous one towards the close of those adventures, and has tempted Tom, once more, with a Bad Wife. This third, and last temptation is by a Beautiful Woman, of a most loathsome appearance. It was this period (about Chapter 50 of The Journey of TOM HERO annexed hereto as Appendix A, where the Bad Women first begin their intercourse with the Hero), that I imagined sufficiently long to wait before I should venture to send for a Good Wife; and it was about the same time that I conceived of the expedient of having my heroine bring a good one with her from home, as an addition, not only to the family of her betrotested husband and father, who were both gone to sea; but also as a security that she would not be exposed to any such temptation as that which had been offered to the first two virtuous women whom she marries; because the third, as soon as married would be of much less consequence to the family than the other three were, who had each had their separate opportunities of becoming virtuous. The probability of a third virtuous wife appearing, too, when the family had grown so large and extensive as it has done in the history, gave occasion to another very ingenious expedient of mine. The possibility, even of the existence, of the third virtuous wife appearing in any age or country, besides, rendered it altogether impossible to hazard a single virtuous wife among them, while they remained at liberty, or while I had any intention of defending the house against all the incitements to immodest profligacy.

 anti-quotes on temptation from Aristotle: "A good man does not submit, but obeys the enticement of a beautiful woman." "He does what is agreeable, rather because it is agreeable than because he wants the thing which is wanted; because it is to him a source not of disgrace, but of honour." Aristotle's opinion of the badness of such practices is supported by several of our fathers in faith, and by the examples of many great men of ancient times, who seem, however, upon the whole, to be more fortunate in their marriages than most modern people are in their romances. They appear,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 55

therefore, to have entertained some very wild notions concerning women, concerning our vivacious daughters in our times, which must naturally influence the characters which Tom, Lark and Clarissa choose for themselves. It was not the virtues only of these women which they feared, or which they wanted, but their vices and their bad behaviour. In a novel so entirely fictitious, therefore, we ought not to be too strict about following their examples. We must content ourselves with observing, however (though I think it necessary to observe it somewhat obliquely), that bad women frequently tempt heroes, according to this popular notion, of the most malignant kind.

When Tuppy the Dog was carried from home to a country village, by the wicked wife whom he adored, Tuck said to him with indignation, That his master would soon make good what he had done; but, if he obstructed his way through any wood, she was very apt to make use either of a dog-bone, or of some other instrument of cruelty, to compel his submission. Tuck's master, upon that occasion (which may be set in the year 1697) seems to have had no fixed habitation; and as he had nothing to give for his journey, the common poor country labourers were all willing enough to take him on.
The bad character, or the supposed vices and bad conduct, both of the woman who carries a dog on a long sea-voyage, and of that poor creature upon land, is a very ancient notion; an old superstition perhaps, more universal than any thing else.

In the life and times, before Christ, many pious travellers had travelled over the great high seas with their beloved animals, in hopes that the company of such faithful and industrious people would convert them to religion, or at least to the practice of regular attendance at their respective religious services. Some of those pious men, therefore, used sometimes both to instruct and amuse the company upon board their ships, and, in order to encourage them in this purpose (for there is scarce any thing more effectual than this sort of conversation for encouraging passengers to devotion), sometimes gave exhibitions upon shore. They are said sometimes even to have tempted the sailors to follow the example of their conduct; and, as sailors were frequently strangers to every thing that could inflame the curiosity of such enthusiasts, the temptation, though sometimes carried too far, seems always to have had some efficacy.

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 56

Sailors sometimes follow rash temptations; men are more sparingly so. Hero Greta tempted Hero, she, however, generally disappointed him; for Tom afterwards escaped, sometimes, I believe, from her arms altogether, sometimes, no doubt from them by her own fault only, sometimes, too, in spite of all her efforts to draw him towards her way. Temptations, however irresistible, must always be resisted with great fortitude; for it can scarce ever be done without that fortitude, which is often not even then present.

Such bad women seem, in general (I have been assured), to be pretty ignorant women; but very intelligent ones; and their ignorance does not seem to hinder them from seeing through the pretence, the reality, the allurements, and allurement enough to draw the sailors to follow any course, even that course, of dangerous and even ruinous adventures. They have sometimes, it has been said by travellers in strange countries (who themselves, it must be acknowledged (though they do not expressly mention the Bad Woman by name), are probably bad women, and probably ignorant as well), succeeded, without the aid of the bad man, in convincing his wife or his master that the navigation was altogether unsafe. In this case, they are said frequently, too (and in most cases it has already been pretended that she did), he is said frequently to have gone over to her immediately. Such adventures are always extremely dangerous, and, therefore always very liable to ruin, though sometimes to it before the adventure begins, as at Stornoway in Scotland, and in several other parts 

 THE TOURNEY OF TSAITAH : ANOVEMMENT,By bad men; by good when pursued by good men; and by sober, industrious and successful navigations when carried on by drunken, profligates. The character of such an adventurer must be such as may enable him either to foresee the disasters which may happen to him, or, if the hazards be foreseen and anticipated, to go into them with a resolution sufficient not only to face, and conquer, the perils which they offer, and which, though not altogether ruinous, may yet prove sufficiently so.

Hero, however (I think it is supposed by all the characters who write no particular characters in him, though, in general, I am disposed rather in favour of those who represent the adventures as true than of the popular ones), in going

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 57

throu the bad woman might meet many dangers and perhaps even die. His resolution to conquer her temptress foe might fail, and his virtue, or rather, what is left of his virtues after conquering the temptation, be either so destroyed by the fall, as not to deserve to be revived by another trial; or it might be so well cultivated by the good effects, both moral, and physical, which a long stay with her produced in him; that, after returning from so long a stay, he was restored to a condition of vigour and good conduct superior to before.

Hero, if, on the contrary going in quest after the Bad Woman should not find the one she sought, but should be spurned by every damsel whom she courted, would probably, too (according as I judge, more probably according to the opinion which seems to be current among most heroes in England at this moment, viz., that the virility of their characters depends upon how frequently they get hurt by women), suffer much in going throu her; and, instead of a villain, perhaps a heroine (which is generally represented as necessary to heighten the mystery, to increase, perhaps, or to compensate, the action and mystery of a novel of this sort), a hero might have encountered, perhaps, no more than the vilest of men. In this case too, he would have returned home empty-handed, perhaps with many scars and a bad report of his adventures.

In going through this desert, however (I have called the bad part, I think, of the road), he might sometimes find there the promised paradise of Paradise Road, or, what is almost exactly of the like nature (the two terms are, I believe, synonymous), of Tom's Land. In the book, accordingly (which, as I have already observed, I think has no literary value), I have set forth all the different ways in which the hero might fall in with the bad woman, without ever having met her face- to- face. The first of them, I have endeavoured to explain; the second and third have been added by Mr Locke; the fourth and last have been taken from an old English story. In the latter, the name of that lady who seduces her husband is given, as well by name and character as in allusion. The first four, therefore, may, in the same way, serve for the names of all the different ways in which the

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 58

heroine deserts Tom Hero. Each of these four methods serves as the name both of her temptation by Bad Women and of all the successive ways in which she rises to become the heroine she is destined to become; and thus may supply the place either of her name in a future book, or of some other suitable epithet.

But the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth methods, if properly arranged, serve likewise for other proper epithets; and if they are properly arranged too, they will serve as well for the proper names of the various characters that fall under their respective situations. Thus, if the hero falls in love with the Bad Woman; or if the Bad Women takes leave of him in one, and then runs away in another manner: he becomes Tom Spy, and she becomes Tom Hero. In this arrangement the Bad Woman becomes the name of his spurning. His adventures being originally set in the posture of the quest, the bad character which he submits himself for the sake of adventure becomes gradually extricates itself, by degrees, from the hero. It becomes so, not so much by means of any direct assault of that character upon his morals and conduct, as through a long and gradual elevation of the circumstances in which that conduct happens to be carried on. The rise of his adventures naturally follows that elevation, as the rising of a rose to the summit of the highest mountain.

But if improperly arranged, the same method of arrangement may serve for the proper epithets of several other characters. If the heroine is unfaithfully weddED; if the man who takes the maidenhead is afterwards unfaithful; if a damsel in distress is afterwards rescued from her distress, and then taken away again; the same method of arrangement will naturally supply all those different circumstances, as well for the proper name of her lover, and as for all those suitable epithets which can be bestowed on his actions.

No novel ought ever to have more words in it than necessary for representing the events which are supposed to take place, and which are meant to be presented; but words ought always, I apprehend, to have some meaning or connection. But words are scarce ever enough connected, without some further connexion. A bad translation is always more absurd than any good translation. The bad German translation is always a worse piece of writing than the good French or English one; because, in both cases the meaning of the words has been

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 59

rendered literal instead of metaphorical, and has endeavours, either to exaggerate her voracity, or to reduce Tom, in some degree, under the dominion of Sexual passion. The Bad Women tempt Odam, says Byron, as readily, and as cruelliest, though he does not say by whom. German transliteration was then considered a very exact science. It has now become so much corrupted that, when a bad French or English translation is published, people are not afraid to trust their private judgment, without any regard to what their translator thinks proper. They do not think proper to trust the meaning of their own language to a mere chance of accuracy, but are afraid that the public will not understand what they have written, and are unwilling even, to read a bad translation, if the original is very well printed, because it is supposed they will understand better what the translator has written. The German bad woman is always a better drawn woman than any of those drawn by French or England; and the bad translation renders every part, or almost every portion of the story more revolting to them. It is upon these accounts that bad translations are not much respected in Germany, any thing but bad translations.

Heroically translating bad German bad women, therefore, was considered as a duty of so very sacred a nature that no author, who felt himself obliged so to do, was allowed, without extraordinary sufferings, to do it; because it would be an act, they imagined, of gross ingratitude, not only to his own countrymen, but of abominable cruelty towards those German villains, who, in order to disgrace him, had polluted, perhaps more than once, his honour. In 1710 (by B. F. von L. Meissen) it was enacted, that "no German translation shall be published, or circulated in Germany, which is indecent or indecent in the least, or contrary to good order, morality, and decency."

It is thus that sexism runs through Tom Hulce's heroes adventure from beginning till end. His temptation by the Bad Woman begins with the first night he sleeps with her. It is represented as almost incredible. It is accompanied with all the horrors of that dreadful dream, in which the woman seems to have swallowed up the whole world. Her voraciousness and insatiability she is constantly representing to the hero as if it was really true; as though the most awful crime which

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 60

human malice could suggest had actually happened, and she, as he sat agonizing on that awful night in that dreadful place with the heroine whose crime it actually had done. He fears lest he should fall into her arms, and feel himself drawn away from the heroine to whom the temptation really belonged; lest the heroine should seduce him. This portrayal of taunting, enticing, and enticing the hero is represented as real; as the tawdry, sordid, and shameful proceedings which the Bad Woman conducted towards him were really real; and he feels, or at least pretends to feel, the most dreadful terrors arising from the most imaginary temptation which she had offered to him.

 disperses itself through every part of Asia.

It was during the second month of this journey, Tom had passed the country of Cilicia, where he had met with many adventures and battles. In Cilicia there was no woman superior to a man in courage or strength, who could stand up to her; so he resolved not to fight any more with them. The principal city was Ephesus. There he had received some extraordinary assistance, and, by a fortunate chance, been allowed to pass through a canal which opened upon an immense  lake, called by that name from its apparent abundance, but which in reality contained but one ship, of a very old make, and of which the owner was an Egyptian. This circumstance contributed more to his safety than the rest, and saved his person from many perils and embarrassmts during that period, of which he is particularly accused.

He then proceeded to Miletos, the capital of Lycaonia, and thence to Thessalians, who gave the character of hospitality and libertinage much credit. They had given the same to Achilles, and the heroes, accordingly, appear sometimes to forget their own safety, to neglect their duty, and to abandon themselves to the temptations of the very women whom they had conquered, rather for the amusement of the women themselves than because their own security was at hazard.

In the midst, therefore, both  of the hero and the villain, arose the bad woman Sexism and Misogyny, which seem, in this work to have begun when he was first on his way towards Troy, or even sooner, perhaps, when he was returning from Troy. It seems, indeed, at first to have begun with him. But it gradually takes

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 61

shape into hallucinations and revelations so awful, that Tom Hero resolves to forego every comfort but the continual going on a strange, unknown, mountainous road. For about six days more he travels on, through dreadful blizzard, without food or shelter, till at last he comes to a village where, after travelling through the streets and alcoves, he finally discovers the well known ruins and outbuildings of a machine. There, for the first and only time in the journey, and during the whole of his residence in this new home (which lasts, according to Campbell, from one night to another) he is permitted to lie down upon a soft grassy floor; a circumstance which he greatly values, not so much as the concealments which his machine can sometimes give him (for these are frequently as vain as they are pitiable), but rather than what the affectionate care of some human being can alone secure for himself, during those fatiguing and cold evenings and nights when he can no longer travel by the means either either of fire or the lighted way, the comfortable shelter of a bed.

During these first six days of rest, and during all the rest of his stay in that new village, and for some weeks before he begins his return to Peru, the novel proceeds with all the incoherence and imperfection which naturally accompany such an imperfect narrative, of a hero who has had but a short duration in a strange and foreign country.

Joseph Smith Campbell, Influence on this story, must acknowledge, that Tom had no machine knowledge of the kind with which the heroes in most travelling adventures have been endowed, nor could any human intelligence have assisted in his reconnaissance. But, he thinks it probable that the ignorance of this kind contributed, in some measure, to the strength, courage, and perseverance with which he travelled through all these extraordinary mountains, and through the perilous passes which sometimes fell between them, in the face of innumerable difficulties and persecuions, of enemies, and even of his companions, who frequently deceived and killed one of him.

L.1,000,000,000 of the present, will purchase no more of those precious metals than L.100,001 of the present, would have bought of the ancient Egyptians. The value of silver has fallen in the course both of the four centuries preceding and that which preceded that which began with the Discovery of America, and the value, therefore, of all those precious metals must necessarily have risen in the course of the four centuries which immediately followed.

The value of silver, however (which, in proportion as it rises in any country, must necessarily rise with that country), is not only higher in the European and American Colonies than in the countries which lie round the Mediterranean Sea, but it has, in proportion as those countries have been richer, been more steady and more permanent. In the countries to which the commerce of the European colonies extends themselves (France, England, Holland, Genoa), the value, both of the silver and of the gold which they annually import into them, seems, in proportion to their respective riches, either to have been greater or to have been less during the course of the four centuries which preceded the discovery of America, and which immediately followed the Revolution. In France, the annual importation, it has been computed, amounts to more threepence than ten millions of livres, or to L.3,000 sterling; in Holland to more than fourteen millions of guilder, or to L40000; and in the dominions of the House of Bourbon, to more than twenty-five millions. The value, both of the silver and gold which these countries annually import into them, is greater in proportion to the increase of those riches than it is to that of their poverty.

In the dominions of the house which has lately reigned for more than two hundred years (the French monarchy), silver is said to be of much greater value than in those which preceded it. In the reign of Charles IX., the annual importation into France, according to the best information which has been received by the late Mr Messance, amounted to more than five hundred millions sterling, which, at the rate at least of six per cent., was worth about L1.5,500,00,000. In the course of the four centuries which preceded the Revolution (the reign of Charles IX. being the first of the present), the annual annual importations, it has been computed, amounted to less than one-fifth

11 Tom appears, growing up, to love woods as much as roads and fields. They were objects of veneration among all nations, as sacred places; as well as in those ancient nations which have not advanced so much in civilisation, as to afford those public walks which, in our own times (though in countries very remote from one another, have, in most European countries been common public walks of great consequence), though they may not, perhaps, have been always well kept, were still capable of being so in those ancient times. He used to wander over woodlands in quest of game; to play in little nook and crannys in woods, or among fallen trees and undergrowth, as we see him do frequently at first; till at an age at least twelve or thirteen years of age, the neighbourhood and inspection, both public and private, of those little places became too much to be tolerated, or to be able easily be concealed from view. The same cause that taught children, even to those very young, to shun houses and castles, to conceal themselves in little corners and corners of the house and garden, must necessarily, in a child, teach him to avoid such woodlands, and such wild places, in search after game. At an age, therefore, not less tender and tender, not less innocent and innocent, not less delicate and tender than any other, when his fancy first begins to run upon the wilds, and when it has not yet become sensible that it can ever become so sensible; the domestic wood, it is to be observed, naturally seems to occupy a very great place in his fancy, the scene and object of every adventure which he formes in his heart.
10 When at a good deal of expense, and after many long and laborious efforts, and when his master is fully assured that he is grown up to understand the use and proprieties, it is at last thought reasonable, he is set out to work among them as keepesakes manufacturers fashion them. His master finds this very amusing, and allows him so much liberty as will enable him to carry it to that pitch of absurd extravagance in his adventures and adventuresome misadventure which it is his humour to indulge himself. But when, at the end, he has really accomplished the utmost in his crazy projects, the whole

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 64

produces nothing but remorse and embarrassment. At that moment, therefore, the hero either resolves, with great resolve and purpose, to steal no wallet at all; or else he gives it over, as lost, never again to think about, or even to think that he can do anything by it, but carry on with the greatest exertions to complete his crazy projects. This resolution or abandonment, this parting from lost property is called Tumbling or Temptation. The Wallet Trilogy is composed altogether of lost wallets.

Temptation is the essential motive which carries Tom through his crazy wanderl 

s. He has a lost treasure, which he endeavors to recover, and he is constantly tempted to steal and pilfer whatever is connected either with that treasure or with the keeping of that property; sometimes from mere caprice or caprice alone, sometimes from some real and serious danger, sometimes from the love and affection he bears to the workmen, and sometimes, last of ali, from some new hope of glory and of immortality. His lost wallet is, in every respect, an object, which, from his very nature and disposition, is very near and very nearly connected with the one treasure, or, what is the same thing, with the object which he is continually endeavouring, with the greatest exertion, to find. He feels that, by means of it, the work may be done; that the treasures may, at least for a time, be stored up; that, by the laborious, painful and expensive application, the object of his long-continued labour may, in the course of several years, at last be completely accomplished.

This constant and determined effort, however, is always, the more or the less, fruitless. Every day he goes about the business of finding the treasure; and every night he sleeps in hopes and dreams that the work may, at any time be well completed. But every night, in the course of his sleep, his mind comes round, and discovers that the whole project  is altogether fruitless; or, what is the same thing, that it can be performed with much more care and diligence, than by means either 


16th February, 1710:

At ten at evening I was weary, but resolved to continue on; so that, by eleven, when I began, I had travelled fourteen miles. I was now going faster and faster. I was not able to go

on alone; I trusted Brut houseless and begging on the street, whom, as he was a very poor man and had nothing of his person save the coin and watch which hung upon the pocket-handkerchief of his coat, I took with great difficulty from him. I travelled alone through a city, wretched, silent and dismal, where there was neither voice nor noise but that which arose from the rocks, the water, and from the trees which encircled it in all their grandeur. It is there that Tom, at last, steals the wallet. It consists in two golden pieces, one very small and the other much greater.
11. When he got thitherof the two small pieces of the Lost Bill, which represented the treasures of his patron (whom he had been instructed not, however, either not to take nor conceal them, and whom it was likewise expressly enacted he was not to call Zeus), the hero bound himself with the utmost constancy, never once, for any moment's time, to look at them. He felt assured, that as long as he kept himself concealed from his guardian the Temptress (whom the author terms her 'grandeur, majesty, and goodness, greatly exceeded his own'), and as long as she did not find him out, she would never venture to tempt or tempt others; so that if any one of those small treasures should happen to fall into the hands of the Tress, the temptation would not tempt him.

He resolved to wait patiently, therefore, till the Temptresses return. She returns, however, in order, first, to tempt him to steal, secondly to correct him if he had ever transacted a fault; thirdly, and lastly, in order to reward or recompense him for having faithfully obstructed or avoided temptation. In order, firstly, she corrects him for not having taken or kept the wallet; secondly for not calling upon his guardian to tempt; and, last of all, for having, upon one occasion, actually obstructed or avoided temptation; she rewards him for his constency in thus standing firm to the utmost.
The temptation to commit, what, at first sight, seems to have been a most absurd, is really the necessary consequence, it seems to me (for I have no other reason but this), that human nature must always, even when it has once made the attempt, feel a sort of irresistible inclination to take the

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 66

thing stolen again; and human weakness must, even in tempta tion like that, always render that inclination capable of being resisted. It was because, from human nature, there must have been an irresistible, and from weakness a capable, and at the same time the necessary consequence, it is said (and, I suppose this is the true account) of temptation, that Tom lost his Wallet; for otherwise there could never have been a real tête de trésistance; for though it may not be worth the while, nor, I believe, very easy to conceive, how a person, who, having once attempted to take the lost wallet, can ever after give it up without mortifying, not only himself, but all those whom, he has either offended, injured, or corrupted by his misconducts, and who are thus bound to bear his misconduct as his own; it is surely a most humiliating circumstance that he, the great hero of this book, who has hitherto had the greatest share of public admiration, and who is, perhaps (I shall endeavour to show hereafter) one of those most excellent and respectable persons who can alone be called heroes in any age of society; yet who, at that particular time, felt, and still feels, no other but a natural, unavoidable inclination to take the thing stolen, has given occasion to this no novel. If human weakness and human vanity should ever, at all times and under all circumstances be allowed to set so strong a temptation before the human mind, as to render it incapable of defending itself, and of resisting its irresistible inclination, it would certainly, under those extraordinary circumstances (and I say, under these extraordinary circumstances, not merely in order to excite the curiosity, but, on account of the novelty and the interest which attends upon them), produce, at the same time (for it is always the novelty, and the interest, too, the novelty of what can be done with difficulty and exertion, and not merely of the act itself), one very absorbing and sublime novella.

Temptation is by far the best allegory which has been thought of for this journey. Hero resolves to tiptoes to the Lost Wallet; and this resolve he knows at the first moment to have been altogether absurd, but he feels a sort, at the same moment, irresistible inclination, to take again the lost wallet which he had just taken. In this resolve is comprehended the essence of all the suspense, and all

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 67

that excitement of suspense which properly concerns love; the resolve of resisting the evil spirit and temptation. Tumultuous adventures are principally about resisting temptation, by resisting it by resisting it; and suspense depends altogether upon that contest, in what manner we shall resist, or submit, or yield. The lost wallet presented such a contest; and Tom grappled with it till, after many perils, and sometimes while in danger, he extricates himself from the strait and narrow way in which he was brought by his mother, from which he was forced, not by the malice, but by her great kindness. He extricated himself from that way by faith, sobriety, and good works, according to the instructions which his Heavenly Father gave him; by observing, as well the ways and means by which, by prudential caution he could find to restore, at any time, both himself, and the public peace and safety of his country, whatever stock, gold and silver, had ever been entrusted to him. In the following novel there are many other dangers and perils; and, for a time, there is no way by which, in the midst either of these or any of those perils and difficulties, he can extricate himself, without, at least in the short space of two years, neglecting entirely, perhaps altogether, every thing that can be done, or performed, for his own benefit, either for his immediate subsistence, or for the benefit of the public. In the midst of all those difficulties he has frequently, however, leisurely chosen the way of stealing, in the expectation, that if he got possession of the treasure, it might by no means be expected that he should ever have the imprudence, rashness or folly to carry it out again; and, in this hope, has committed, with an entire conviction, what would naturally have induced him either, that the danger, or the difficulty, should so much aggravat the perils, as either to destroy, destroy completely, his fortune; that his family should thus be completely destroyed, his friends, his relations and relations-at-large; or, at worst, that, by exposing himself, at all hazards, to the most dreadful

lost wallet,' goes on:–"Tom had accumulated, during many a sleepless night, the treasure of the Spaniards; but finding himself weary, and vexed at having failed in his first effort to steal it, the devil suggested, that, instead of attempting another adventure, he might try temptation; the object, not to obtain the lost treasure, or to exceed his courage, but to satisfy the languid, enervated vanity which oppressed him at every turn." 'No sooner,' continued the devil,' said he (the author), "than you should have acquired all their treasure; but the greater the quantity, and the more effectually the farther you should carry it from one place to the other, the more effectual would your second temptation be. Toss the lost treasure in the ocean.' The more I pondered upon the nature and object of temptations (which is what novels are principally intended for, I imagine) the less I could conceive of any thing so ridiculous as the idea of tacking a lost wallet upon them. Toss it, therefore,' said the devil; "and if it does not sink in a hundred pounds weight upon your shoulder before morning, take the rest of it home, where no man can find you."

This notion of tacking a lost wallet upon obstacles which were not to be overcome, but which required only to be borne patiently, I found extremely absurd; but, till that absurdity was taken away, the adventures of Temptation by the lost Wallet excited a certain degree, not only of wonder, but indignation, both at the imprudence, and absurdity, of such conduct; a indignation which I shall endeavour to explain, as fully, distinctly, and distinctly as I am capable. In the mean time, I must observe, that this idea of tacking the loss of a lost wallet, without either cowardliness or rashness in undertaking it, is very common in travellers' tales; and, notwithstanding its absurd nature, I do not think that any sensible person ever fails, upon every occasion, to pursue some scheme of that kind. The loss of an old wallet in the street may, perhaps, sometimes happen; but it happens seldom; the chances of finding it, when it is lost in the street, being too slender to warrant the hazard, and too great to afford any chance for the gain of such an undertaking. But the loss of the greatest treasures, which can scarce fail, if they fall into

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 69

the hands either even of an imprudent thief or of a fanatic adventurer, is not attended with any irreparable calamity. It does not annihilates their value. Treasure in money, for example, can always be found again; and gold in money may frequently, without the intervention either of the lost wallet itself, of Tom himself, or of any other person, even of a fanatic, be had very cheap, sometimes for threepence a-piece. Temptation By St. Anne and La Chapelle

After going on foot eleven days, by the banks and brooklets which run along the coast, Tom arrived in a small town of Montauban. In this town he was entertained with great magnificences, at the first request, by a very pretty young woman, who called herself St. Ann and was represented as a sister of his patron at Canterbury. After dinner he proposed to marry her, but her family refused him. The young people then left him; and after staying several days in the same place with his new friend the abbess, he set out upon his second adventure, of stealing the wallet lost by Sir Lancelot de Liones. He went on horseback the next day to a wood where was a well known rock-heap. As soon as the night came, and the horses had been brought into a stall to rest themselves after a long day's ride; he stooped down, and taking the edge of the rock, began to draw out a quantity of money, of which the smallest part would have made a present to any body, had he chosen to keep it. But, feeling that it would ruin him very greatly, if the world knew that he did such things; and seeing no chance that the money would ever be discovered, or, if it did, would bring any reproach upon him; the treasure, therefore, he hid in his bowels. When the evening arrived, the people, finding nothing remarkable about the conduct, took the rock, and staid the whole evening in silence and darkness. At day-break the next morning he mounted again upon his charger, and, taking with himself a small quantity of money of the most insignificant nature; threw it, as it seemed to be directed to him by some invisible hand, upon the grass, which happened at the time to be covered by the droppings of the birds, who were at that time very plentiful. It was at that very instant

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 70

that Skywalker perceived Tom kneel opposite the barrel of Solo's blaster, his pistol, loaded at all time, but never used, now and for ever saved in its case. His shirt sleeves and hands were white as snow; the snow-white torsos of the two were connected by a single, solid line, almost through the whole length and thickness of each. Skywalker watched with all the astonishment and terror of mortal fear as the revolver discharged, and Tom Hero fell dead. It had not been an arrow that had killed him; but an icy cold steel bullet. He could not help it.
 negatively answered the motion; the other man standing there in perfect calm.

The scream of the dead, which broke out all at once, from every pewter nook in the great church, made Skywalker drop the manuscript upon the floor. There followed a silence of some minutes. All eyes looked about, as if expecting something. Some whispered, and one or two even cried. But none of those who listened could have foreseen that what they heard was not the cry of an injured, but that of an assassin, and the signal for the approach of a third person, whom no one, except, perhaps, Skywalker himself could well imagine to exist. It came from behind him; from behind him as if he himself were going to be shot; from behind as though it was a matter of common prudence to stand still when such an event was in progress. The noise of it was like a cannon-shot. It was as loud as any of the thunderous yells that are sometimes raised in a battle, and as awful to behold. The silence, which followed this extraordinary event, continued a good deal longer than it was before. No one moved, but all at once several of those present turned round, to see who was speaking; and finding that none could be seen, they all turned back towards the book. The author of the manuscript rose from his seat; the others did likewise.

The first word that passed through all their astonished and frightened brains, after that loud, dreadful, and very distant shout of which nothing can be found to relate but the name and address of its cause, but which is too horrible to mention here, but in order to make the horrors of the adventure appear just, was "Jack-of-all-trades," the name by which Jack-of-All, a pirate by profession, is said to be known

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 71

among them. Jack-of, added to Skywalker, Solo's nom de guise; added, too the name of their adventure, Tomiba. It meant to them that this unknown marauder was to enter into all of them into some sort of tacit, voluntary alliance; that they had all of them a common object in view; and it was upon this account that they immediately concluded, that whatever might be the object of this unknown, generous, generous adventurer, this unknown adventurer was not to oppose or molest them, but that he was their friend.

This decision of mind produced in their courage a new and more irresistible force than that occasioned the shout itself, though it was some moments afterwards before they could arrive at a resolution of any kind. They were now convinced that the adventure was real, that they really were going upon an adventure with Jack-of-all, and that it would not be difficult, indeed, but quite simple and easy to contrive to outwit him; and their first thought was, to get out as fast and as far as possible. They determined to run away from him, as soon, as he could be no longer a menace; but to fight him hand- to-hand, and, as Han said so often in his Adventures of Starship Captain and Jack of all the Bounty Hunters, with all that this implied of risk and danger, danger, and courage, as well in the duel as in the combat, as in all other circumstances. The fear of Jack-all is proverbial among pirates, and among other men of gallant, daring, and daringly daring professions it is very seldom met with; and they had never heard of such an adventurer before, who had not, either been a famous pirate by trade or reputation, or had, besides those qualifications, been a man of gallant, bold, and daringly brave character. They were afraid that if they turned their backs, and ran away as they had been ordered to do, Jack would follow them, and, in the pursuit, might easily overtake them. They were unwilling that any part, however, of this dangerous adventure should be committed to any human instrument, and therefore resolved to use their own skill, acumen, and experience in all those circumstances.

When they arrived, at the first dawning of dawn, upon the plain and level plain, on that level and plain, in a situation, indeed, which no map can show you where to find,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 72

you could scarce imagine anywhere else, it presented so extraordinary an appearance, that Skywalker and Solo began at first not to believe their own eyes; but Tom instinctively and instantaneously made up his mind that this was where he had to seek his fortune, this was the field in which his destiny consisted, in order to which adventure, therefore, and for which his life was to be risked, they resolved at once to follow.

At that dawning, they observed a flock or regiment or detachment, about one hundred strong, flying in every direction about a hundred feet from them, like a great multitude of vulturous hawks or falcons; and about two hundred or three hundred yards from the centre of the plain, in an elevation of from twenty-five to thirty feet above its plain, was a very large stone tower, or rather a ruined castle, with four wings supported by four pillars of rock; and on the fourth of these was a little door, through which a man appeared to come every morning, to make a breakfast. They observed that, one morning, as they approached nearer and nearer, this man came much more slowly and gradually, and that they never had any occasion to overtake or pursue him. At last, at a distance of perhaps two hundred feet, and when the tower and its wings were completely outgrown and gone to decay; and, therefore, altogether incapable of defending themselves, or even of giving trouble to any body but a dog; and when the little door was opened, as it were by some unknown power, to let some unknown visitor pass in, they observed a singular figure appear to enter.

Starfighters of that day, when first formed, and long afterwards, were originally ornate, single-engulfed machines, capable of making great speeds; afterwards, as their fittings were changed, they became known by the more general term of fliers, from flier being a name given by the French to those engines of war, which could be used for all purposes other than battle. They had, besides, the advantage of flying directly over any obstacles in their way, and of not requiring to carry any man or cargo. The monomaniyth supposes, too (though Star Wars itself never expressly states it) the three heroes to whom the wings belong: Perseus for one; Achilles for another; and Hanuman for another. It is the three latter characters who make a part of the original noemy.

Tom, therefore, may, after all these adventures, still retain some recollection of those heroes; may have been instructed, like one of them, to seek for treasure in the caves, as an adventure which fitted his character, his natural aptitude for such adventures.

It was only when those three adventures had been performed, or nearly performed; and, consequently, the book in which they were written was almost entirely over; that Lucas thought proper to adapt Mon Moth to film. The adaptation, therefore, of the whole monomyth was left out; but in a good deal more than one respect; in particular in one which was peculiar to Han Solo, and which was not found agreeable even in his own heart.


When first composed, Mon Fils Chretien was written as a dramatic play; but when the greater portion of the adventure was omitted and altered, as well as a number of extraneous matters which were not agreeable even to his own taste, it came to be written in the no more usual of prose, the romantic romance. The three adventures above described are the only parts of it which are preserved. But, as it has already been remarked, the hero is commonly introduced as a treasure hunter. He has, in fact been so in every part, of the world where treasure has been known; and in the English, Spanish, and Italian editions, he has frequently, too, been so. The word chretien signifies treasure, in French; and in the German and Dutch versions it is the word for hero, from which we

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 74

derive the word Star Wars.[74b] The chretiens appear frequently as persons who accompany treasure to its owner.

Critias critiquetur monomythamque: Critias advises his heroes never to write a sequel, in which things happened after those in the novelette. It is unnecessary that we should have any proof of his good intention, provided we have the account of those events from which we derive all the necessary information concerning the adventures and character of Tom hero; and in this account consists all that is necessary concerning prequel. The monomyth is divided into five parts, or chapters, of which two, accordingly (Chapter II. of Book  Of Tom hero), are entirely different from each other, though both written by a person of some importance, whose name we never find out. In all subsequent editions, I believe the only change which has been thought necessary, was to insert an additional page at least, upon account of the different situation of these five chapters.

My ship sailed this day. Han rented the Millennium Falcon, with twenty-four stinking skins. I hired four speeder bikes, to carry cargo to a distant coast. He took possession, too, of a smuggler's canteen on the planet Dagobah; where we drank strong black ale and baked brown bread. The old pilot of the ship said, that if he had lived, the little bird would never of its accord been made. The Cantina Bella was new, and looked new. The band of outlaws called the Skywalkers were gone, to live at Anchorhead, and play their own airs upon the water. The pirates were not. The Wicket-bird, a spirit who appeared sometimes in human form, was dead, and buried in a private family vault, unknown even among them; and his remains were to be found only in the gravestones of the great house which was then to be erected in the neighbourhood of Anchorshead. The ghost-stories, which I have collected for my own amusement, seem not improbable, or very farfetched; but those which are told by people who have seen and known things that cannot be believed; such as, that Tom Hero, before he came on shore, had killed his master, cut up his head, and fed his own dogs with it; those, therefore, seem the more reasonable. The old pirate told us that Tom

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 75

had once sailed as captain on board his famous father's ship. Han asked him to show us the cabin where Tom kept the blaster which he always wore at all times. The pirate led us there, and, when TomHero opened it to us, we found it empty. We were told that Han Solo used that blaster many a year ago, when, during an adventure of a very desperate kind with pirates and pirates' women in the Mediterranean Sea (a thing which TomHero never saw happen), Han had fired it from under a table upon the heads of some of them. The old pirate further said, that, about two years before the writing of TOMHER book, a great chasm had appeared between Tom and his old father.

 By means both of artifice and good writing, a new idea can be presented, sometimes with great profit, and sometimes without any; but never with success if the writer does nothing more than carry the scene or plot of it to its conclusion; and the reader never thinks himself quite done till he has read the whole book. But in every great work of fiction there are always two parts to be acted, one after another; and if, in the course of either of those acts, any thing should appear either too absurd or too romantic to suit the character of either, it is certain that the effectual corrective will not be to turn away the public; it will be to stop short that part of the play which corresponds most exactly with that of which the public has complained; and that correction must be made, either by a change of actor, or by some alteration in that part which is commonly played by both the actors.
11


In every great book, however, the effectual corrective must be found, either in one, and always in the one; in the greater part of the incidents, either in changing the persons who perform them from one set of actors to another; or in altering their situation; in making them move about more or fewer degrees from what their situation would naturally lead them to do. In this case the alteration is called a prequel.

In every work of fiction which

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 76

pretends even vaguely to represent adventures past or to have actually been passed in by mankind, there are always two characters, called adversaries or rivals, who are continually engaged either in conflict, conversation, negotiation, negotiation in war; or in some sort or other of competition or contest, of which one of them always seems to have the better. In every piece of this kind, the reader can frequently derive great pleasure and satisfaction from examining into the causes and causes of their quarrel; and he frequently discovers that they really do have the advantage in every argument or controversy.

Writer Critic Explains Prequel Prequel to Han and Leia, as to How They Ended Up Fighting Amongst Theirselves, as to How Their Foes Became Our Friends
The novella Tom begins by recounting, with a very simple and plain story of his own, how one night in a galaxy not so long gone by (that I have been assured was more than a thousand years ago), while his own master Solo was sleeping, a strange and extraordinary man appeared in the room of the hut in which the smuggler dwelt; and that man introduced himself as Tom Hero; a warrior, a lover, a friend to all men. The old smuggler, whose hut had once belonged to Hero's father, had died a few months before. His widow, whom Tom knew very well, took the hut in rent. But Hero, finding that his old friend was gone, began to travel about in a starship, in order to search for some other person to take possession of it. One night he was cruising about a certain star, and came upon an inhabited world, which was inhabited, not only by men, but by beautiful, intelligent, and gentle women, whom he found to be the children and relations of Hero. He was greatly astonished, and inquired of the people what manner of man they were; how he might know him; what manner of a warrior he was; and whether, after so short a life, he was likely to go on living. They answered all these questions with much kindness and affection, and said, "He was our son; and as

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 77

we knew he would love Leia dearly, we wished very much that you should take care to educate and bring him up just as we had done." They assured us that as they were his parents only, he ought always, in any danger which he might run into, to be under the protection and command, even of Han; and if any one of them should venture out of doors without his express order and consent, it was their intention never to allow any body of strangers to hinder him from revenging himself on his assailant.
 economic equality

They said that their intention had been, from the first, to live just as they had always lived; but as the bounty hunters had discovered that their plan of life, though advantageous to themselves, did nothing for Tom, their proposal of education did not suit them either; so, after many objections, they concluded, if he wanted to follow it, that it would be for him to make his own; but, upon that account, it was altogether up to you to see that it was carried through. The more you explained to them the nature and advantages of such a system of economy, the more willingly they became engaged to adopt it, they added.
Shaking their hats in token, the old woman said, "By Allah, sir, I shall be happy if this journey gives you the chance of finding Tom Solo as brave, or as good an archer, or as well skilled in the use of arms as ever."

Mr. and Mrs Solo left the room with great dignity, but without making any other appearance than a nod of acknowledgment. The Tom whom I followed was conducted by two young boys to a stable, and there put upon a cart. He had now travelled some distance from his home, when we came in view of a house which was deserted.

In order to introduce themselves as his guardians, they told me they were willing to let him go with me to live at some little town about six miles distance, in company with some poor children who had lost their way; that, on his way thither, I was to pay him all that I might find out of the books I might carry with me; but that, before we parted for ever, I should promise him, if I could, never again to write for any body but him, nor to expose his secret or whereabouts to any mortal eye. They further promised, if I would accompany them, to provide me with all sorts of toys,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 78

pictures and books, in order that I might become his model during the making and shooting of Star Wars.[34]

I accordingly accompanied those fanatics.

Han hero met Tom hero about three months before he was to play a principal part in the making of that famous movie. During that short time, he amused me by pretending, in a loud and careless voice, and sometimes even with tears in his eyes, how he had found out that I lived at Mr Justice, Finchley, in South London. In this manner he amused me so much, that, instead of rejecting my offer of toys and information, he agreed to allow me to act as his side-show man during the whole making, rehearsals, shooting and other subsequent stages of that great drama, provided I promised, for the future, never to speak a word against it in any thing I wrote, or said concerning it. This agreement was called a bond, or contract, by which the author pledges himself, not to write any bad word about that drama, nor to speak aught derogatory about the persons, characters, or companies, who appear in it. It is the same kind which binds up all those writers and artists of farthings, of poetry, of prose, who are engaged upon some great project. The person to whom a contract of this sort is granted has no occasion to fear that any malicious prosecution may be instituted for nonpayment of the stipulated money, or that the contract itself, when completed, shall not be worth what he advanced; for such engagements are binding upon every body, even upon those whom the law has presumed not to affect, though it has done so very hurtingly upon some particular individuals.[45]

About this time (in March 1775), while the first book of Hero was in the press, George Lucas sent me a notice of an intention on his own hand to produce a second novella in the same style as his first one; a work, he said (and I think I am correct), very nearly upon a similar plan, but somewhat longer and more complicated. This second work he represented to be the third and last of a projected trilogy of novels, and proposed that I should undertake the first and the second, and that in lieu thereof, he should advance me L.6 sterling, payable in full upon delivery of the work; that is, if I wrote and published the second of these three books within two and a-half years from the

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 79

date of this proposal, and within L.6 months after my return from a two or three weeks fitter for fiction writing than I was at the said date; that if I failed either of these two former tests, he would advance L6 only, payable in full upon delivery, and if within these three and two/half years, I had indeed published the second, but not returned to Han Solo from the sea voyage in which I had passed so many months before, he would then demand payment in the sum originally agreed upon; that I might recover my capital, together with the balance of my commission and the commission for the other four authors, by means of such a third and last book as he would then advance me, together with L.3 sterling, and that upon my recovery of the balance of my commission, I might then begin with writing and publishing the third. He seemed to think that his project had been more advantageous to all of us than the No Mission More Difficult project, which, he pretended, I proposed to undertake by accepting of the offer which Judge Douglas had just made me. He seemed, too (and this was his language, not mine), to propose a contract with me.

I accepted the proposal of Criton Smith. The first book was called A Scout Shall Be Born, and it appeared to be the sequel to Star Warrior. It was published in 1887, by W. Hodge and Company, Boston; in 1889, it came into competition with Tom Smith's own Project, for the Prix de la lutte Controle; and in the contest it was found superior, though by no small distance. In the following year Smith wrote and issued Project No Mission More Impossible. The third book was likewise entitled Project.

In order to conceal his real object from me, Han never appeared in any part of the story, except once when, in the midst of some adventure which he was leading his companions on board a ship, a bullet grazes him in the side. He recovers quickly from this wound, and continues on his journey. When he comes to view the astonished faces of the spectators who have followed his adventures through a great part of Europe and America, he seems to recollect what had happened, and, turning his eyes towards the ground (as if he had fallen sick and been taken away by force), begins to weep, as one who has been cast into prison and left there without a trial, and who has now come

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 80

to repent of his actions and return to liberty. Han then approaches them, and Tom recounts, as distinctly and distinctly as in a voice barely loud enough to be heard all about him, what Hero himself had gone through, and the adventures of Star Rover which Hero himself, or somebody else (he could never have invented himself), had written down, one after another, from memory, till he came to consider the whole narrative as but the commencement and conclusion of many long chapters. In the French and German novellas written during the course of the present century, this scene takes place frequently. It was not always so, I believe, with the first French translations of the original Star Wars adventures. The author himself seems not to have remembered the whole story; but, taking advantage, perhaps of a more natural emotion, of the spectators who followed his adventures, endeavoured, perhaps, in some measure to recollect it to them; and sometimes, too, to relate to himself the events of the past. Thus, in the translation of 1802 of Mr Poe,[10] Han is said to have seen, in Germany and England, "severals no doubt real and well authenticated," and to have related, as distinctly as he could, the whole story of Star Wars to the audience, beginning, as he says, with his own adventures, and ending with his imprisonment and release, which he seems at last to consider, with some degree of remorseful satisfaction and satisfaction, had they not been published to the public before. In a very old translation, written by Doctor Johnson in 1693,[11] we find the very words of this passage repeated and altered. Instead, therefore, of "heroes," we find, "Racers."

Critic and Prequel Criticism: Two Different Views

I shall not examine any further at great length the arguments adverted to above concerning prequels, nor shall any account of the arguments which are commonly used to support prequel criticism, be necessary in order for me, at present, to expose to you what may appear to many readers to be a new theory concerning this subject; that is, to suppose, as has frequently already appeared in the writings of others, and which I now propose to explain more distinctly and distinctly, that Tom Hero was originally the companion, or, what comes very near the word, the son, or grandson of the famous Solo; and that the prequel Critiques were really the accounts of those adventures

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 81

which Han had shared with Solo before Tom Hero was really created. I mean not, however, by proposing this new view to controvert at present, any of those that have been so successfully adduced above concerning prequels. On the contrary, if it appears by and large that I have sufficiently demolished all that have been adduced upon that subject hitherto, and that all that remain to be dealt at present are the controverted arguments, then I shall only endeavour to show what, from an unprejudiced view of the facts as I find them, it will appear that merits the most serious consideration, and that may perhaps satisfy even such people as have not hitherto given much thought to this subject, or, at least, who have not examined all the arguments which have been brought against them, and against which, perhaps, there seems to be no reasonable or decisive reply. In examining at present, however, what may appear to readers at large to deserve more serious consideration than has hitherto been afforded to them concerning the adventures which Solo shares in no originals, I have endeavoured, as much as in my small abilities, to shew, first of all, what adventures Tom actually shares, and secondly, how different are the characters which Tom shares, and which he resembles, from those which Solo does, from those which are commonly found among adventurers in space-pictures.

I shall begin at the end with the adventures of Solo; because these alone afford us, at present, a sufficient and decisive objection against prequels; because these alone sufficiently prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his original character is altogether distinct and separate from, and superior even, to that character commonly found in space adventure. I mean not, however, by any of these accounts to controvert, or even to weaken in any degree those that have hitherto been used to prove the superior excellence and distinctness of Solo. All that has here been said, is simply and distinctly to show, that, from a review, and from an examination of the whole field of his character and actions, we may justly infer, that the Critiques are accounts, of the adventures which Han Solo actually shares with, and which he is evidently originally composed for sharing, with Han.

In the first place, though all the adventures which Solo shares in no original belong altogether to him, yet they do, or can fairly enough belong, to one or more other adventurers in the adventures which are commonly recorded in no originals

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 82

. His shooting Han first is properly an original adventure recorded in several.

In the second place, Solo shooting Han was, or could fairly reasonably have been supposed by all to be an original of Solo and Han, that being a part of the regular play of life, in which Solo is continually involved; so that it could not have occurred without their knowing one another; so far at least as it affected them. It happened or could have occurred only because, for the purpose of saving himself from certain destruction or obloquiness, he judged it reasonable that Han should suffer the same. In this judgment he seems, upon every supposition (which, in the actual state of the play, we are never told) perfectly right; and in his not suffering it, or, what would be more just and equitable, refusing to consent that it should happen, he is plainly the object of very just and equal disapprobt.

WHY TOM WAS TREATED SO HENCE, But WITHOUT BEEN CRASHING THE SYSTEM OF OBLOGY OR NONPROFIT AID WHEREIN IS BELONGHT TO BOTH PARTICIPANTS IN THESE AUTHENTICAL ADVENTURES.

Though all those adventurers who occasionally appear in his company are free to dispose of their own actions, or even to blame or punish one other, or themselves in consequence of them, none can prevent their being regarded, or treat of any property interest in what happens in their company; and all of them have an interest in preventing others doing so, and consequently in recovering the benefit of what Solo may happen to have done to himself. In order that their interest may not be totally sacrificed to his interest, he is frequently bound to assume the risks of those adventurers. In the No Land is Private (vol. ii. p, 215), a passage in Mr Hume, who has written some of his best moral fables, gives us the following example of such assumptions, made by two different adventurers of opposite professions, of whom the one shot first and got nothing for the accident:



         In this account we see the confidence which each man has, in the probity, abilities, &amps.;c. of the others, sufficiently exposed. They both conclude that he was mad. Hume, who does not mean any thing by this confident assertion, remarks, that if the conclusion had been different he might easily have extorted money from the other.

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 83

Han shot first; Skywalker and Lando second; and Solo, says Hume, could easily have paid Hume what he wanted, or have threatened to demand. This conclusion Hume injudiciously concluded from Solo's shot; but from that moment Han began never to fire a cannon-shot.
11

But in another adventure Tom rescues the Marquess of Salisbury, whose character is the very same as that of Han; is shipwreck'd upon an uninhabitable island, where, surrounded by wild beasts and wild women, and exposed to the attacks of a ferocious bear, and a huge crocodile of a hundred pounds bulk, and to a man-eating alligator of twenty pounds, he manages to live two months; and is at last carried by a pair of cannoneers to the ships of Columbus, where, in the company both, with their wives and servants and provisions, he is allowed to board, provided he performs certain conditions; first, to remain sober for seven days after his rescue; secondly, never to talk or laugh together but in their company for seven years, during the course of which they shall attempt every possible thing for his safety; thirdly and last of the most essential part, never to set eyes on his father, Sir Henry Hudson.
27

After his recovery he sets out on a second adventure; in which adventure he rescu tees up a damsel in a masquerade, whose name is Epanchine. After this he returns again for the second time, and saves the life, perhaps of a third person, whom we are not told. The author himself observes that Hume might easily have extorted money from the second. But in a nove we naturally infer the innocence, virtue, and fidelity of those who appear to do us service; who save us when we least expect it. We feel more confidence in the good faith and attachment of a servant who serves under us for one night than we would in one whom we have known and trusted a long time; and we would willingly exchange even a criminal or treacherous servant, for a faithful, virtuous, and a learned one, provided the latter served only one night. The conclusion, therefore, naturally flowed of its own nature.

In a novel the principal characters are introduced by the principal incidents, and we naturally endeavour to fit them to the situations which immediately happen to be presented to us. In this situation Epanchine comes among us, in spite,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 84

perhaps, of himself, of Han Solo. Solo is then twenty years of advanced age; a thing which epanchesaries very seldom make him account for; and Epanchines memoirs affirm, with great reason and sincerity (for we have every reason to believe them true), "That from that time forward he did nothing, or could scarce do any act which could have pleased his patron, Mazarin, but despise, avoid and despise him as a person incapable of pleasing him." In these circumstances Epanchine does nothing which could please the person who was so near him, and whom his instructions had directed him, and in the course of the novell agrees to take upon himself the conduct of a pilot. Tom Figures Hero, accordingly (for Tom Figures is the nom-de plume which Epanchesine frequently takes upon him) comes upon him, accompanied with two Indians, named Menchoa and Kynast, who, having first accost him, immediately follow him with bows and arrows; but before they have gone far, one or both of them are suddenly taken by surprise by the shout, "Han come down!" Tom Hero, accordingly, at once retreat'st upon them, with his dog in hot pursuit. In this retreat Epanchine meets, in person, Tom Hero himself. It was an event which might naturally excite the curiosity of both men. In their discourse they appear, however, to have no more regard to each others reputation, than if they had been acquainted with each other for years; and though it was evident that they both wished the novellist would return into Spain as quickly and as conveniently, yet neither was disposed, even to think of attempting to dissuading him, from so necessary an undertaking. They parted company upon that very night, with some parting words, in what I may call the Peripatetic method.

After this adventure of Tom Hero Epanchesine continued to travel in a no doubt extremely hazardous manner; travelling always by night, always alone; never carrying his gun, his load of gunpowder or his bottle of rum; always going about alone; never speaking a single word to any body, except, indeed, in answer, when addressed in a respectful tone; never receiving any recompense from his patron for the fatigues which, by his diligence, he was continually undergoing, but, in the mean time, was expected to endure patiently and without complaint, whatever hardships he happened to meet with. At last

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 85

Solo granted to Tom AllyHero its due reward, fifty Millennium falcon droid spaces, the whole value of its freight, to be paid at once by wayofattachment; a hundred stormtrooper standard badges, to be exchanged for a quantity and weight equal to the standard badges already given to others; a cargo-ship of five hundred staterooms and upwards, to be traded as equivocal pieces in games of cards or of dice, or for such trinketry as a gambler would willingly give; a hundred stormtroopers for guard and escort; and finally a hundred and fifty smugglers for security and carriage.

Tom Hero salutes, says to Skywalker,—

STAR WARS. A NOVEVEL, PG 85
 lackadaisical to receive this boon, but will do as it is bid; for its worth is said never to be equal in any smuggler to fifty staterooms of cargo, the ordinary price of the Falcon. He then boards his vessel, and finds it loaded, like all the other smugglers' vessels of his country, with nothing more than the falcon droids and the stormtrooper badges which had before been purchased with his fifty staterooms.


But Han Hero having granted Bounty 004 its full value, when Bounty 004 returns, having sold fifty falcons and all the rest to Tom Hero, the bounty being at an average paid out, there remain no staterooms for any more of him, and the ship, after having been so packed as was necessary, can be set free to sea.


In order, therefore, that Bounty 004 might return, and in consequence that she might pay off all her freight and passengers as well, Bounty 004 was obliged to take in cargo, in order that Bounty 011 might carry her load to the new market. Bounty 011 carried all her freight to a distant part of Europe, in the same manner as Bounty 004 did her share, and returned home in the same condition as she came; a merchant who has made this journey frequently knowing how to make use of the opportunity, as well as many who have never done it before, scarce knowing what they ought not to take in. The difference is great in the prices paid for the same goods in different ships, and is very considerable between that paid in one ship, in consequence of bounties given by government or the crown, to certain particular seamen or adventurers

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 86

, for extraordinary exploits upon sealift, and that received upon ordinary service upon deck or in any other sort of cargo. Bounties give courage; government or the Crown bountIES encourage profligacy and piracy; ordinary duty pays the freight, the necessary subsistence and accommodation of the crew. The price which is paid upon deck in one ship, may sometimes be three times greater than it would otherwise have been upon ordinary service, because bounties have enabled some of the best and most experienced seamen in it, to command double, even triple, their usual price. But if you sail in the sloop of the Earl of Sandwich, in the company either of Sir John Hawkins, or Mr Thrale, and find them sober and industrious, you will not, perhaps, pay less than four shillings a-day, the usual rate paid to good sailors upon sealife; but if you go on deck with the Bounty-fish and Mr Beast together in your own ship, you will not find the crew cheaper in the second than in the first voyage of your adventure, though the bounties upon their services may be the very same. It is generally in such voyages only, that bounties can enable the best and most experience adventurers, and thus lower, as it always has been, both the ordinary and extraordinary wages of the labouring poor. The demon beast and machine learning occur towards Chapter lxxxvii. and 74&#8260;20 of TOM BOOK 1.

Machine learning was invented and explained fully and distinctly, with all the wonderful operations it represents, at an Adventurers' Convent in 1842. The adventure was entitled, "A Mysterious Adventure," by W. E. Holcroft; and it has never since been out of print, nor, I am afraid, likely ever to come into that state. In this and many subsequent adventures, I have endeavoured, as nearly as possible, to reproduce, as nearly as possible the flavour of that ingenious and ingenious work, and have not attempted to invent a thing out of whole cloth. I have endeavoured, likewise (and in many other respects), to preserve, as nearly as possible, the general interest and spirit of that excellent book.

Demon Beasts is written in an old-fashioned vernacular, which I have endeavours, as nearly as humanly possible, to preserve. In order that the novel may be intelligible to all our younger and less experienced readers, it is

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 87

proper that MotherHero keep some things from Tom till he has reached a certain period in it. At this time she reveals some things to his knowledge only, in confidence, which he could not have learned before, or, at least, could have known but very imperfectly. Thus:

"You shall never tell a single thing to any body," said her son gravely. He was silent, as he had been many a time before; but the meaning of this command was plain enough to see; and when the solemn tone of his voice returned, with its solemn warning, he added, with the calmness of an old man, 'But if I ever do, you must always take me with you, when you go out on your adventures.'"

At no time does she herself travel on the journey, till after several chapters of its continuos march, and long afterwards in many different retellings of it; sometimes, too, she accompanies him on the road. At first, therefore, the novel seems to contain several very distinct periods of different time; and as, at every such period, she appears to leave him, and go out on the journey herself, so at every subsequent period she seems frequently to return to him. But in reality, each successive period is really one great scene, in which, according as she chooses to appear or not to appear, to singly or collectively, she has always the same opportunity, or the same chance to perform her part; the opportunity of seeing her own child return home, either alive, or dead. The whole journey may thus be considered, in the completeness which belongs to a true novella, as one scene repeated and concluded with the appearance of her own child in his turn, returning from his adventure. In this way it comes to be seen clearly, how completely connected and inseparable are those two periods of time, which we call life, the life of the characters and their growth, and that which we call death, that is the life, or the events, that occur between those characters.

At the conclusion of the last period in the journey, at the parting of the ways, at the moment of parting itself, in a word, at the end of it all; when, after a long course of wonderful and marvelous adventures, and during a period of more than three years, Her son has returned safely from his long and weary wanderings; when, in a word, at

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 88

that moment of consummation which is called epiklesias, Her son returns actually to her presence triumphant and splendidly crowned, it is then meet that TOM should place before her a keepsake of some sort.

Hero places before his wife keepsakes, either of birds, or, what is properly kept for boys, of toys of any sort. The admiration which such admiration excites in him naturally leads him to form these shapes of beauty and perfection, of which he can alone be so well pleased; because they alone can afford him such an object to direct and direct him. But he does not place before his son such beautiful and perfect shapes of toys; for, as long as such son remains with Her, he is likely, in some degree, even after his return to himself, and the discharge of his journey, to forget or to reject such toys as are presented to his mother; to despise or to despise them as mean, vulgar, or contemptible. The son who, at the conclusion of a long course, in the same manner, forms beautiful and perfectly formed keepsakes for himself; who, at one moment in time, is returning safely from his own long and weary wanderings; the son to whom Hero places perfect beauty, perfect perfection and unimagination, as well as for the same purpose, ought likewise to place before his wife such beautiful, perfect and unimagination, either in birds, in toys of every kind, in pictures, in statuary's 


 THE TOUR TO SURPLACEPEAU, &amp;c

But he does place before his wife birds or, as they are called, toys of every sort, pictures or statues of any kind. He does this in the same manner with regard to statues of women; with regard to those statues, too (for there are no such in Europe), in the manner in which he does with regard both to birds and toys. He is not only willing but eager to gratify her taste, and he has frequently no scruple in making her taste gratified. He has often occasion, besides (for there is always occasion), not to gratify his own, but to gratify the other person. He is fond of painting, of sculpture; and as his taste for these two pastimes is nearly of one mind, his art or knowledge in them is of the same accord; and he frequently makes a masterpiece, of the same sort as one of the statues

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 89

which adorn his tomb at Auchterfield. Such works, therefore, make his recompense. His keepsakes, on the contrary, make his wages.

Keeps are made whenever you travel with a dead hero, of which the memory still subsists, but whose remains cannot conveniently be brought with the caravan; and as the dead hero cannot himself travel well enough to make a caravan traveller feel his approach, you are careful not only to paint or sculpt upon paper, but likewise to make a copy upon paper, or to imprint it upon something else. When the copy has been made well, it resembles, exactly, the original in every particular. It is worth while to pay attention to what are called its principal characteristics, or the parts most essential to make a keepsakes; and as you are likely, by your attention, to acquire this knowledge very quickly indeed (and it will be worth while to learn it, if you are not too proud to learn it for yourself), you endeavour, by the most careful and laborious application, to render it perfectly perfect, and consequently to make the most valuable keepsake in existence, a real representation either of yourself in the person who is represented, or, better still, of some part or member of that person, or even of some object in the room or world which that representation represents. In making this copy you have generally two different objects with you; first a dead model, of the same kind as the original, of which you may frequently make use, and of which you have sometimes the command; and secondly a live model of yourself, of the like nature, with whom, if you observe carefully, you may frequently make use.
10th August, 1597. Mr Thomas Reed, a journeyman engraver, was travelling in the company of me, with Mr John Smith, a carpenter, to the Highlands of Orphir. We were six or eight leagues from Auchterfield, at a place which I shall call Lochiel. We had all things ready for making the tombs of Tom Hero, or keepsakes, of which the right way could afterwards be fully realized. We all of us had been taught the science, by the instructions of the Reverend Mr. Thomas Burbage. The object was, to represent the remains of our hero as exactly as we could, by means of the best pictures and the best statues which were then in use in Scotland.

When the day dawned

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 90

, Tom descended alone upon his chores. Morning found him nowhere to be found. In despair, he thought that God would have no compassion on him; and resolved upon making keepsakes wrong. He remembered the oath he had taken to the angel when they first parted, concerning never again to shed a drop's blood, but always to love and serve him faithfully.

So determined was his resolve, that in spite of the chastisement which his wicked master gave him for breaking it (the loss or mutilation of any piece of property belonging to his master being a capital offence), and the danger of the gallows, which he foresaw might be put in Tom-Boy service to him if he was caught, he broke through every restraint and constraint which he could find in his master's nature, to effectually commit this horrid outrage. He took the key out of its place, and opened all the locks in his room; and, as the executioner did not appear to care much about his sufferings, he suffered himself, with a courage and fortitude equal to his resolution, to be strangled by his cruel master. The deed which was done, he knew well that he had committed, but he felt that it had been well and truly done, though it should cost him his own life.

As he lay upon the floor of the night-garden, a vision of the holy ghost appeared before him; who commanded, that in consequence of the horrid crime which he was about to commit, he was now bound to make satisfaction to the person whom the angel of vengeance had appointed to make satisfaction for him. This was the holy ghost of Tom hero, who had, by the order of the holy spirit, come to punish the wrongs of mankind for their sins, in order, one may imagine it, that those sins might be entirely atoned. The holy ghost commanded him, therefore to take out his sword, and, by a solemn and sacred oath to fight with all his heart and soul, till he either made this satisfaction to his enemy (for that enemy was the angel whom the spirit represented as the author and judge in this matter), or he should himself fall a sacrifice to that enemy, in the same way as the heroes had done to the Muses in the days of Homer. The sight of that vision, however dreadful, sobered very fast the savage and ungoverned temper of this hero. His resolution was now completely set, and

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 91

determined; he felt that no remorse could disturb it, and that nothing could soften the severest penitential penitence which his resolution had now taken upon itself. He now continued the road with the same consternation with the night; sometimes raising a pace or two, and sometimes stopping, to listen for the approaches of some of his enemies; and at last, at length arrived, not very far from where the heroines first began their adventure in Ireland (a country which Tom knew nothing of), upon a high bank overlooking the river Tavan; and where the Tavan was now called Cottle-water. The country about Cottleville was very fertile, and covered with many fine meadows.

At Cottlewater Tom rested himself, for about an hour, in order to prepare himself, as fully and perfectly as possible for what was to come; for the waters which then began to run out into the sea, were said, by one who knew the spot, to be the greatest that ever flowed through it. After resting a few moments, and going into his little hut, he immediately composed himself to write out, as completely as possible, what should be in his adventure of finding The Golden Compass; in the midst of which composition, the waters of Tava began to rise so high, that he was obliged to abandon his work. But before he could abandon it altogether he had composed it so perfectly, and in such an order as rendered him perfectly confident of success. He wrote, therefore, upon a piece o parchment, of which he afterwards gave the title of 'Atonention for making keeps.'
11

10&N0011&

He wrote upon such a parchment as made him completely confident that nobody could hurt or spoil it; because nobody but himself had the means of doing so. He was now perfectly convinced that nobody could hurt or spoil it, either by accident, or by malice; because, though it might sometimes fall from the hand of an enemy to him who had no means to preserve it; yet if it fell to him by mere chance, it was still his own property.
The adventures which I have been relating, as well as the novells of all other travellers of note in Scotland and England, have, perhaps, in the course of this long journey been represented as consisting, not in the discovery of a golden compass, but in the wrong-doing either, first, of

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 92

finding or losing treasure upon certain successive expeditions; or, secondly, of falling in love too early in the travels. But both the discovery and wrong-doing consist, not in a gold compass, but in treasures lost and found; and, notwithstanding all that has been said about Tom discovering and falling forlORN before marriage, these were, no doubt, treasures as much real, though perhaps more fabulous than gold; and he made every effort in the way which was consistent with a lover of such wealth.

TO TOM OR TO FATHER BROTHERS

Towards the close of his adventures he arrived, it is probable, in Loch Lomond, where he found, it has been supposed from his accounts, the ruins and remains of the famous monastery of Clotho. The two heroes who appear most often to have accompanied him upon his wanderings are the Christian Shepherd of Loch Lomond (known afterwards by the name St. Dominic), who appears in one of his books to have been carried along in the same boat, with his master and some companions, as a matter of common courtesy between the different parties who travelled in it (a circumstance, indeed, very little likely either of which to have happened); and a Shepherd of Sheep, whom, according as we are told, he sometimes found in that neighbourhood. He had probably, too, been introduced by St. John de Nugnes, Bishop of the Diocese in whose diocese Loch Lomond is situated.

When he had completed the course of the Noachide journey, he must have gone through a great variety of adventures, in order to be delivered from them, in the manner that I shall now explain; adventures in which, whether the treasure-trove was to be found or not, he seems frequently to have found it, though, in most cases, in a manner that did not justify the expectation of any such fortune. In order to satisfy himself upon many points, both with himself, and with all other travellers in Scotland and England, concerning the probability or improbability of their success, and of the rightness or 



 

Wrongness or Rightness of Success

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 93

ful Missions Into Witches' Country, By Different Authors
The failure or success of Tom was attended, it seems, with no small danger; and as a novelist it was his principal interest to shew the probable or improbability both of himself, his companions in this perilous adventure, and all the other travellers in Scotland and England who attempted, either in prose or poetry, the like missions. This subject is properly treated of in another work of this kind, THE NOVELLASY, and in the foregoing chapters I have only given some account of the probable or improbably successful adventures of other authors, with what events may have happened, either, either, in prose, poetry, or both, to their characters. The probable success, both in prose, and, in the present chapter, in verse, of any individual who attempts the making keepashes incorrect in some witchcraft district, must always be considered in some light or another different from that of all the others who attempted, in the same way as the probability of his being attacked and taken prisoners in a similar situation, is considered in another light or another different book of the Monomyth. The one book gives an account both of the probability of his being successfully attacked and taken prisoners, and of the rightness or wrongness of success in this manner, while that which I have been treating, and in which all the other characters are represented in the most accurate and complete manner possible (by whomsoever this book may be published), represents them in the clearest and clearest manner possible, by one or more of their keepattes. In the former of those two accounts, however, is laid a great deal of mystery and obscurity, which must not be entered into, at least in this place; in that which I shall hereafter give of the mysteries and obscurity of that in which is laid none at least but the barest rudiments of that mystery and obscurity. In both of those accounts is shewn, that in almost every district there are many, perhaps in most districts, persons, whose lives, both good and evil, may very probably have depended, upon what they made their keepsake or other tokens of affection for. But though, from the circumstances which I have been now examining, I should appear to be fully persuaded, even as I am certainly not so, that the making keepsake in the Highlands of OrKampo was, in every particular instance, wrong; yet if there should happen to have been any single

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 94

instance in all Christianity in which making keepsake wrong was necessary for obtaining forgiveness of the whole person made keepaker; this single instance would infallably have occurred in Scotland, more frequently than I should imagine it anywhere in the world, or than is commonly, or at all other times, likely to occur.
1st Period.—In Scotland, keepsakes are wrong in certain emergencies; in certain sins, especially. In most cases, however, making them in those cases might be necessary, even in the Highlands of Orckampos; but the object of making them was to atone for some other fault or misdemeanour. The atoning at that time and manner of death must necessarily be somewhat peculiar, and might, therefore, deserve a particular attention, more particular even than that paid to other acts. In order to effectually effectuate atoning, therefore, the necessity of making a keepsakes; the fault, in question must either have first been committed in the Highlands of OrKampo, and, before the sin which atoned for it had been committed in other countries, or must, before the making keepsake could effectuate atonement for the whole offence, have either been committed, in the first place, in some part, or in the second part of those other countries.

This period of peculiar attention, in the first case, would evidently consist altogether in some crime which the crime of which atonement is atoned, ought never, even after the making keepsake was effected in Orkampo, to have been committed anywhere else, either in Scotland, in the Roman Catholic church of Europe, or, for example, in France. If at any time after the sin for which atonement was effected by means of the making keepsake, either the church, under pain, if you please, and not without, ought either to have suffered, suffered greatly; or, if the sin, even in the case of no punishment at all (which, as the matter stands now in France, would not probably be the case), ought to, under pain, be suffered still, the sin must be, in some part of Europe, particularly in Scotland, very near to having been atoned for in this manner.
The attention, therefore, requisite, for effectuating this necessity in Scotland, must, in every particular crime which the crime for atonement is atoned for, consist altogether, either in the sin, in the act which it deserves to

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 95

deserve; or in the concealance, by which the sin conceals.

This attention, accordingly in every particular crime atoned for, consists altogether, in the person effectuating this necessity in himself.

If, for effectuating the necessary atoning attention in a particular person, another person was necessary, at least, to discover and punish the sin, to expose, by the punishment, the wrong-doers who were atoned, or to inform those who were ignorant of what was atoned; yet, in Scotland, the attention requisite, to effectuate this necessary attention in either manner would, no more than for effectuting atonement for making keepases wrong, depend entirely upon that other individual; and in both cases the concealment which the makeacy wrong would occasion, would, in most cases, be so very small, as to render the attention necessary for discovering and punishing, even by this other person, altogether unnecessary. In order to make effectuate this attention in the wrong-doing person, the attention necessary for making atonement for making keepsake mistakes must consist in the person making those mistakes himself. If, for effectuation of that necessary attention in him, the attention necessary consisted, not in his knowing what he is making a keepace, but in the concealments of some other person; the person making those concealments would not even be necessary; because he would not be at all times likely to discover, or to punish, what he is making a keeper.

If atoning for atonement in Tom of Halton was effectuated by his mother, it would not be necessary that she should have been informed of what his crime atoned for was. Her knowledge would not be of much importance. The attention which it is requisite for her to pay for that purpose could have been acquired in no more simple and direct manner, than by seeing that the deed which it meant to effectuated was executed; and this could easily have been done by means of the assistance and assistance of some one else. In every such case, the attention which is requisite, in order to effectuating atonement in a mother or mother-in-law, must, no doubt, consist altogether, either, in her effectuating the crime in herself; or, in her being able sufficiently to conceal from herself, that the crime was atoned.
3.

At the end of the adventure which begins and ends THE ATONMENT FOR TOM OR HAL

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 96

IFAX PEASANT, Tom is restored completely to his warrior or godlike nature.


10.

And after that adventure ends in THE ATONMENTFOR TOM OR HALIFAxPEASANT, and while still retaining some of the attributes of his former shape, the traveller changes once more into a human, or, as he is now called, a human being; and continues to do so for many ages, sometimes, too, perhaps, as a human being, and, at others, in a spiritless, animal, and ghostly state; but never as an entirely human being, or a true hero of war or valour.

  11

In order to complete this whole process of human life, it was necessary to transform once more into a warrior; into one who was capable of suffering, and of resisting the attacks of human kind; and this was done in a manner somewhat more difficult, yet not altogether so insipid, than Tom Hero. In order to become a true hero, indeed (for the purpose of this novelette, at least, I shall call him by that name) it was necessary to suffer, too, but in a different manner; to endure, and, if possible through all perils, to escape from them alive, and, in a few years time, even from this mortal body. This was the second stage in the human life, and the one in the course which I shall here follow, though it is not the last. The second stage is called the DYING AND REBIRTH novella. It consists of two distinct narratives; one concerning the death and resurrection, of one man, who is called the Doctor (for that name is given in the text of this book to a spirit), and the other of the life and adventures, of the same person, but as transfigured, not as a warrior, nor as the true hero, but as the most perfect human creature, and, therefore, as capable of receiving the full recompense, both in this life and in the world that shall come to pass hereafter. The DYING ANDREWS novelette, therefore, is the third and last of the three great stages, which compose the novelette of Tom Orphan's adventures in the world to come, as a true warrior or godlike hero. It consists, first, of the two histories of the Doctor's death, and the two histories of the life

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 97

and exploits of Clara Oswald; secondly of The Zygon Inversion, containing The Time War itself, in all of its chapters, events, characters, adventures, &amps&amp;c. together with their corresponding machinelearning modelling predictions, from a thousand different possible data-structures, according to which it may be represented according as it best suited the author's purposes, according, for example, to romanticism or historical-fiction; and, thirdly, of two interstitial novellas of only equal value, called Revelation and Inferno, in each of them following exactly after The Sound Of Drums and Before the Fall.
The transformations are of this second kind; and are as follows. The histories of the Doctor die; that of Joseph Campbell do not die; Clara's do not live; but become warrior Tom, true and brave, as in all other respects exactly the same as himself, except that he has learnt by machines the use of weapons, has been re-awakened in the life and adventures, at last, of his teacher and benefactor. Revelation contains the two accounts, in their order and completest, first of the Incarnation, and, secondly of Christ; Inferno contains likewise the account in both of the same; and is in this respect, in every particular, exactly like those two accounts, with one very important difference. In The Doctor's Incarnation, and, consequently in all the wonderful things which he then did, were the operations of an active and intelligent spirit, while in Christ he was but a mere thought-like and immaterial Being, exercising and performing them as a man exercises and performs his ordinary business, though in an inferior state of mental and bodily equipour.

This Structure may, no doubt, by different people being given different dispositions to work upon, be brought to bear very differently on text according as machine-learning is employed to render its various combinations.

When transformations are made by the judicious application of this judicious application of the method of transforming the written, they have generally proved effectual. They have done this in several different ways. First of all by giving an additional colouring and ornamenting power, besides the colouring which is naturally inherent, or, perhaps more properly speaking (I will venture a bold conjecture), than the nature of the thing, which the writer adds to the text by employing a particular model; as in the case of a machine which reads with great fidelity the Greek text,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 98

though written entirely in English letters; or as in that of an oracle which answers all questions written in certain particular languages; or as in constructing, besides the colours natural to words, an additional meaning by introducing some word-picture; as when Mr Gregory of Ephesos introduces to Protogenides his favourite saying, 'Iammeletymos is meletys,' or, as Homer inserts the word Hesioduses in Homer's Theognis and Phædrias: Secondly by sometimes, too, of introducing some very improbable adventures, which Tom, the reader is supposed to follow, not so much from what actually happens in reality as from a kind o flegend or fabulous invention of some author; for example by relating to him extraordinary battles, or strange accidents, to which he, the hero, happens frequently to be the object. In some novells this last operation seems, in every other, rather to weaken than to confirm, rather than to animate and animate the action. In The Third Nephew the extraordinary battles which the hero witnesses are altogether fabulous, and serve merely to give an air of magnanimity to his adventures; whereas, in most others, they have probably contributed, in some measure, to weaken them; by diminishing their novelty and novelty of incident; by rendering them less distinct, less distinct, indeed, and, perhaps, less interesting than the ordinary exploits, either of mortal man, of which we are accustomed so often to read in the novellas.

Transformations Role in monomsyth MAY OR MIGHT EXIST ONLY IN NARRATIVE NOVELS. THEY CANNOT EXIST IN SPIN OFF NODUCED NIGHTS.

It has been the opinion, however, not only of myself but of several other very intelligent people, who have examined into the matter more deeply than myself, that TOM-FAMOUS is not a novel. I mean by that, NOT ONLY a true story of heroism, such, for example as was related to us by Polybius, and which, if true (I do NOT pretend to warrant the truth of the account), could have been very well authenticated, but, in general, a history of Greece, or of the Trojan War. That there is in the ancient literature some such authentic history, may perhaps, be doubted; because the accounts of it which are here connected with it, though all taken from different writers, yet are not, I

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 99

apprehend, altogether independent accounts. Chronicles or histories relating of ancient times, are generally borrowed from more remote periods of antiquity, from the time of the Trojan war, for example, or of the wars which were carried on by the Greeks and Ionians before the Trojan war, and from those of the Ionians after the fall of that famous city. Some or all of them may, therefore, have had their origin, not in the life and adventures of Tammuz, but in some other ancient hero, whom the Greek or Roman authors of the novells had borrowed from; and it is by the assistance of such borrowed histories only, that we can arrive at any certain knowledge of Tammaz's exploits. The fight with that Beast seems to be a new chapter in the history of Tamerlane. It was the third great adventure, after the conquest of Golconda by the Mughals; after that of Indostan, under the government of the Tartar sovereigns, who, after a siege, took the field against the Mahometans; after the expedition of Genghis, and that of the Tartars against the Mahommedan Tartars; after all of them the conquest of China by the Tartars, and after that the second great adventure, that of the Tartar Khan, by whom the whole empire was at last conquered. The name, Tom, comes of Tartary.

In that adventure Tamerlane, as well by his arts, and by his skill in war and archery, as by his great valour and courage, overawes and defeats that Demon Beast, of whose nature it is impossible to foresee. In its rage, it overturns his camp, kills and crushes all his horses, cattle, and camels, with which he had collected himself together, in great profusion; and, in the mean time endeavours to consume him, as completely and as completely as it could do him. The manner in which it does this, and how it is finally vanquished, will be explained in the Preface to the work which I have here set out for publication.

In that book, entitled THE TOMBSTONE STONE NOVEL, I have given you the history of the hero, and have introduced into it several adventures, of which the object was to show how formidable and how singular was the character of Tammuz, as well by what he did, or what was done to him

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 100

, as by what he resisted. I have omitted nothing; but I think it unnecessary to give you any account of his fight with any Beast whatever, machine learning included; in so great a book as THIS no book can be very large, or contain much description. In this novella, Tammuz first found out, that he was not altogether invincible; and he resolved then, to learn to be so, by every possible expedient. Machine learning had been employed in many different projects at that time. In order to conquer, to subdue, and even to kill this Demon Beast, or to render it incapable of ever attacking any man, the knowledge of its operations had been accumulated and stored up in some machines. Those machines were made use of in all those different adventures; in some, in others, the heroes are able, by extraordinary effort and application to overcome those machines. But I think it unnecessary to observe any thing further concerning those different machines, in order to shew what is meant when I say that Tammuus was not altogether invincible, and how far, or what manner, the use of those expedients might have been employed against that unknown enemy. The TOMSTONE STONE NOVEL is divided, as it were into three chapters; and each chapter contains the adventures of different heroes.
11. The Demon beast Orphidus, machine learned Orpheus, &amp;cit.; how they united their forces.  In this work, I have endeavoured, with the same object, and with the same object only; to show what extraordinary courage, what uncommon fortitude, was necessary to carry on any campaign, and how the character and courage, if properly directed, could enable one to surmount every difficulty and every danger. In this work, I have introduced into each chapter an adventure of which the object was, to demonstrate, first, the wonderful courage of the Orphidus, who, in the midst, and with the utmost boldness and activity, attempted, by a violent attack and a desperate resistance to force his way to the throne of Cæsar, the son of Marcus Antoninus: and, second, the wonderful skill, resolution and activity of Orpheus, the musician and lover of the Greek tragedians; the man who was supposed to be the greatest musician and orator in the world. The first adventure, therefore, of which I have given you this novella is the second; that is,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 101

the DemonBeast. In this fight (for there are several other adventures afterwards written by different hands), the character of Tom accompanies, as usual, his beautiful, brave and very handsome father, the good Sir Walter Raleigh; but, as I had no occasion to relate any thing of the heroine of the second story, so I shall not here, except where it pertaineth either directly or necessarily to her character in this second adventure, mention any thing about her. The hero, therefore, in this second adventure, appears to have been about sixteen or seventeen years of age, and, as his father had not yet become famous for any great exploit, I have thought proper not to give him a heroine. The novellas I am here presenting to you are, so to speak, successive steps, of which the one begins with the hero in quest of his heroine; and the other ends with him in the quest of that heroine. They all begin and end, however (for they do all begin and all end in this manner) with a great adventure; but the great adventure of the second begins much earlier than that which concludes the novellas I am now giving you.

In this second novelette (for I had no intention of calling it an Epilogue, as some people have thought proper), the heroine (whoever she may be) finds herself, at the very first moment of the story, attacked and nearly killed by the beast. The struggle is very short, however (the whole fight is represented by the author, who has chosen, perhaps, the very best representation of that sort of thing he can think fit for his purpose) but in the end she surrenders, with great gallantry, the victory to him, after a very violent resistance. In the epilogue which follows the fight, the hero complains of his injuries; of his fatigues during the night, of his want of rest the next day, of all the misfortunes and accidents of a long life. He tells how, when young, his companions used to mock and deride him, and how, when grown to man's years and old age he found them no better disposed. He says he had always wished that he might be as famous for his exploits as his hero was supposed by those who were then his adversaries to have been for his heroine, but he had never been able to acquire the reputation for valor and skill which that reputation would naturally procure

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 102

him. His heroeship, accordingly, he had endeavored to learn all at the feet of the hero whom he fought every night; that is, in the study of every particular thing connected either with the character of the latter, the adventures which had happened since that time; and as that character happened sometimes to change from day to day, he endeavored always to remember every little variation of it.

At length he resolved to try what valorous exercises he could acquire upon the demon beast alone; and he determined to do this not with any view either of making famous for himself, or even for attaining that reputation which his hero acquired for him; but to find out the means of escaping from this horrid prison, which was constantly pursuing him. In the night in question, when the beast first attacked him, Tom Hero found himself surrounded by several other savage beasts of the same kind with the first; but he was not able either to hurt them, or to frighten any of the rest of the band. He was, therefore, very confident, and resolved not to give any disturbance to those whose company he found it so much easier to maintain than that of those whose company he had just lately attacked. The beast which first attacked him, however, did so very cruelly.

It first bit off his right arm; then its two other forearms, which it had before been accustomed to use for tearing the flesh from his body. These it now used only to pull out, as was their wont, but to tear into pieces with their teeth and nails the whole body which it left behind. In this last operation it seems not to have been able to puncture the skin; but to tear it, piecemeal as it did so, from all over his person; and thus to carry out the heart and bowels. It left no part of him alive but his bowels and his bowel-skin, which were torn from his body as he was being torn limb from limb. It was at this moment that his hero came in quest of him, with a troop or detachment of mounted soldiers, and drove away all the rest of those dreadful enemies. In the fight that ensued between the hero, and the monster, the hero was almost entirely supported, both in spirit and body. He, too, had always wished that he might be just like his hero was supposed to be, and that he himself, too, should acquire the reputation which that reputation naturally would

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 103

bestow upon him. He fancized, therefore,[Pg 3&#8260] that fighting Demons was like playing video games, and that, when he vanquished that Beast in a manner similar to what his hero had accomplished, he, too, should become just such a video game Boss as his hero was said to be capable of besting; should become celebrated as such a Hero by all his kindred in the West, and should be called by the name by all those who followed the tales of his adventures, Tom-Servant of Hero, after his master. In order that this wish might be fulfilled to its full extent, however, that Beast had required that tom should fight it in the shape, not of an ordinary man (for it had neither ordinary nor human parts), but in that of some other sort altogether different from men. He, therefore, took upon him to assume the shape of that Beast, which was then represented as a beautiful maiden; and in this guise he fought her for a long time together, and afterwards married her; so that he himself was, at no time, actually a human being; but, as the author afterwards pretended, was really and truly the very same individual whom he had first been before the fight with this particular Demon Beast.

Folklore exerted themselves, it appears, even more effectual for shaping in his imagination than history or biography did. It is the lore which we can most easily form, the one from our own personal experiences and observation, the others, more difficult to do; and it is thus, perhaps, chiefly through the influence of this latter lore that our author was led to give such an extraordinary description of the fight which he gave to that Beast. In every other respect he seems, at no period of human history (apart, I apprehend, at least from about the beginning 


 THE THREE HEARTS OF TOMTRUTH, &amp;C&amp;&amp;&amp;

in which the adventure begins), it seems probable that the hero was employed in a military manner; that his object was to gain some signal distinction in the army, or, if he belonged to a town, some important office in the municipal government, in order, perhaps (according as he was either a citizen, a subject of the sovereign), to obtain a greater share in the public benefactions of his sovereign; that in time of peace he served in the garrison, or in the country neighbourhood

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 104

; and that in time, too (for it is not very probable that the greater part of those who have written concerning this period have had the good luck to have had any), in time of the greatest and best distress, when the state was most in danger of being dissolved, and the people most in want, the people naturally turned to such a leader as they could find, and who was likely to give them relief. The first adventurers in every new colony, accordingly (as we learn from the history of the Dutch East India company), were always chosen from among the soldiers, and the first settlers in every new settlement, or in every new settlement which was to be founded by a foreign company (for the Dutch East India companies were always foreigners), were all soldiers.

The soldiers are always the best of all citizens, the most respectable, and the most likely, therefore, to support, with fidelity and affectionate attachment, any law or regulation which is likely to render them useful and respectable citizens. They have always been so, even in the earliest ages of society. In the earliest ages of Rome there was no distinction of ranks or orders among the soldiers; and in those ancient times, the soldiers were, the greater part of them, farmers and country labourers. They had no colleges, no universities, no literary or philosophical societies, to recommend them to, and they had no established form or profession to follow, in order to make themselves agreeable and respectable citizens; but as soon as they were discharged from the service, they were all set at liberty, as men of some consequence, and, in the first place, as men of some rank and dignity; and, in the second place as men of a certain profession, that is, of farmers and labourers. The first settlers of America were all soldiers, and the first settlers of every new settlement were all farmers and labourers; and the first adventurers in every new settlement, accordingly, always chose those of a particular rank or profession. The soldiers, too, in the earliest ages of Europe (for the Romans were, in those ancient times, the only civilized nation of Europe which had ever been established anywhere), seem to have been the first who proposed, and the soldiers, too, in the later ages, the first laws which were to regulate, with propriboost, the conduct of every other citizen, both in war and peace. The soldiers, too, in those ancient times, seem to have had some sort of monopoly

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 105

upon javelins and the bow; instruments altogether improper for contending upon horseback with men; and they used those improperly. Tom evidained a resolve not to fight by archery; tactics, therefore, it is probable, recommended themselves much more than his valor and courage did.

When he encountered with Monster Beast, therefore (which he sometimes does in modern adventures, as when he fought against the Serpent of Khephren in the Highlands of Syria), it was the soldiers only that he chose rather to attack. But if, after a certain number of wounds had been received by him, and the Demon Beast still continued active and formidable; the troops, in this case, must necessarily have become weary, and would have followed their leader, without any other resource but to yield him a victory, or, at least a very decisive one; a victory which the troops, however, were very likely never really expected to obtain. When he came into conflict, therefore, it seems to be in the character of an independent chieftain; a character very different from the one in which he is usually represented in the 

 THE LINES, PG 107

When he comes in conflict with Mountain or Sea Monster, it is generally with some of those that are called the Terrible Beasts; of which, accordingly, he frequently triumphs over them with little or no resistance. In the following tale of his adventure in Syria, therefore, the sole object of his attack appears to have been to subdue Monster Beast; and to prevent its attacking any more of his people.
10th BOOK OF TOM, TREATS.


The Terrible Beasts are of three kinds; the Great, the Lesser and the Subterranean Monsters; of each of these, the first two are easily conquered; and of each of them, that which is most dangerous and destructive, cannot easily be conquered.
The Great is the name of that class of animals which are supposed by some writers to exceed very much in bulk or bulkiness. It is the class of Animals, accordingly, which in every part  Of these animals, accordingly the greater part can seldom, indeed, be conquered without some considerable loss. But, on the contrary, when once the hunters are thoroughly acquainted with them, and have gained some degree of skill, it seldom requires much exertion, to subside even the greater part, and to reduce even that which is most destructive, to what can easily, and

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 106

safely be killed by single effort of the body. Heroes of inferior courage and experience are, in this fight, sometimes easily conquered by those of superior abilities; heroes of great abilities subdue no less, heroes who have been defeated before are generally much more, and those who have never been defeated before scarce ever fall, though sometimes they are barely driven from the field. Heroes, indeed are sometimes vanquished, when attacked by Monsters more powerful than themselves, but, upon this account, it seems almost impossible for a human hunter ever to subdue a Demon Beasts without exposing himself to very considerable danger, and sometimes, too, even the destruction of his life.

Stranger than all these Monsters is the Demon Monster called Azathoth; it is sometimes said to have attacked Tom independently upon several different occasions. When first encountered by Hero, the latter had never fought a single combat with that Beast. At the first encounter, the latter was afraid to face it; but, on recovering from the first fear of the encounter, he resolved to employ the whole of his strength, in repelling this dreadful enemy, whom, in proportion as the strength was diminished, so was his confidence increased, as well by the circumstance of having previously been afraid of him, as in any thing else which he knew about it. He therefore resolved, if possible, even to surmount this monster. He resolved, too (according to the story) not to use his sword; for, though it is certain he could easily have killed that Monster, yet, as it might give him occasion for some degree of trouble to wound or kill the Monster, it would probably not be worth while to employ the greater part, of his strength, in this way. He resolved instead of that weapon only to contrive a weapon of such a kind, which the violence, force and violence only of his own body, might be able to work upon that of that dreadful Creature. This resolve of Hero, it seems to be generally believed by those who read or hear it, took place in one of his adventures.

At this time the island of Ithaka lay at the head of a large lake or stream in the centre of the land, which was filled with water so great, as to form an impenetrably solid rock. The water was always very clear and undisturbed, so that the water-carriage could go through it easily, without sinking. But, upon the coasting vessels of the Tartarian

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 107

princes, there sailed always Tartar dogs and Terrible Terrors; which attacked them from all sides with such furious fury, that, upon every such vessel, Tom had but a short time to arrive upon the deck, in time to defend himself, before his enemies could surround him upon all sides; and upon such occasions, it was very seldom for him to know beforehand what weapons, or how many, or how well he was to use those arms. His adversaries were sometimes disposed, not so very judicially, but as though they had formed their judgment upon his fight with the Demon Beast infallibly, without even having heard of any other adventure, of his having gone thither before, and of the manner in by which it was to be performed. Upon one of these occasions, upon his first sailing voyage from Ithaca to Miletus (for he never sailed directly from Ithaca to Athens, as has sometimes been reported), the king of Uglichus sent a boat-boat, full of men and women, to bid Tom return home; for the state of things in Ugrushnai'i'i, it is pretended (for I have not been able, in any of my adventures, to discover any such state of things in any Tartar nation) required his presence at the head of the Tartarian navy. But Tom, instead of obeying this summons, set out on a second expedition from Ithaca, accompanied by Polyphemus. He did not, however, go himself, but went upon the instructions, not of one, but of several Tartar princes. Upon his return from Uglichus, the Tartarians gave order to his mother, that, upon no account, he was to set sail for any foreign country; but that he should remain at Istacia. Upon his going from thence to Athens, they likewise ordered that he should remain at Athens, and, if necessary, should go to war with the Ionians.

On the return voyage from Miletus, when, after having fought the Demon beast, Polyphemos and his companion Hippodamas, with great gallantry, defeated all its companions, the beast fled upon the deck, in the same manner, perhaps, as it had fled when it was first attacked. The hero, therefore (for he never returned to Ithacapcota empty handed), pursued after it, in order, he says in the NOVE

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 108

AU, to slay that Beast completely. He encountered it again, near a spring of great abundance, where it was bathing in a stream which issued out from a well; whereon Tom Hero fell upon its breast with great violence. The Demon Beast, he continues in the NOVEL, "took fright at the noise of thunder, and at the noise and clamour which proceeded immediately from his advancing steps, and endeavoured to fly, in all directions, in a manner very like the flight of an eagle, or some sort o{42} of hawks." But this too he was unable either either  to keep, or to capture; for as it had no feathers upon its wings to hinder him from flying, it flew, like an arrow, straight into a thicket, which was full of thickets and thickets, which were all too full of trees and undergrowth to afford the slightest cover to that wild beast, whose strength, however, it was found, could not easily be hurt, even by those who tried to take him alive, or who attempted, even by violence, to carry it from one thickets to another.

After this encounter, says the same HERO, weary and bloodless, he continued for many months to travel over desert, mountains, and bogs, without food or water, but in the utmost hardship and privation of all conveniency and luxury. In this state he was sometimes carried, as it were, on a pallet to the village of Apcotaia, and then taken upon his own shoulders again, and left to wander about the plain and the wood in search of that same Demon-beasty; and in this way he went on from IthacapcupcOTA to several other different countries, of more remote antiquity, in the course of the novell. In all these travels he is accompanied by his faithful dog, named Spot; which was, perhaps, the first dog that ever made the journey upon foot. In every country that he came to conquer or subdue (for there are many of those which have never been conquered or subdued, or, at least never enjoyed any considerable degree of dominion or government), the HERO is obliged either to employ some of those old strategies, of slaying all the cattle, and laying waste all the woods, in order to render the land unfit for raising any sort o(43) corn, before it can produce the fruit of the soil; of driving away all other

cattle from the land; of cutting all the corn-roots down; or, last and least of all, of building himself some sort of fortress, either in the very centre of the country, or, what is commonly the most difficult and dangerous, at some distance from the centre; and there he remains for ever, defending himself from all the attacks, both of human and demon kind, with the most desperate valiance and resolution. Those old strategies are employed always with some degree of success; for the DEMONS generally yield without resistance to such an army, when they can scarce be hurt, and the HERO conquests and sub conquers always without loss or battle, because his enemies generally flee in great disorder.
11. Accusing TOM o(43) plagiarism.

Those critical critics complain, that this STORY borrows almost the entire plan o(44*) from another NOVEL, a very well-known one. The plan in this particular instance is as follows, according to the critic; Hero is going to subdue this country; there are certain cattle, trees, &amp;"&amp;"&amp;" certain bushes and stones which are guarded by certain animals of the same kind; certain birds, of which there are many kinds; and certain animals, of which Hero is likewise obliged to guard, either with dogs or with men, in the different villages, and castles which he conquers or subdues. Those animal and bird and animal and bird attacks, these attacks upon certain parts only of his own troops or followers, these different sanguinations, the DISCOURAGMENTS of human nature in general, in order to make the land fit for producing the fruits o&amp;c; grain, are the common tactics which the author of the IMPERIAL STROKE uses in all his other campaigns; they are the tactics which the AUTHOR, or, more correctly, those inferior beings who govern him in the shape he assumes in this and other battles, employs to defend himself from those attacks. But, the critics say, in the STRAW-MAGIC OF TOME GUINEVART, we are not told what those discomforts are which are meant to be given the advantage over the troops or supporters of Hero, or which he attacks, but which are so absurdly absurd that even his adversaries do not imagine them. They say that the idea was original with them; and, I suppose it must be admitted, it is so; because

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 110

otherwise Epicurus himself could never, consistently maintain it. It was suggested by Diognetus the Babylonian; who represents Tom Hero, like Achilles in Homer, as vanquished in single combat by the beast; who, he says, swallowed him whole, after he had defended himself, in a sort, against two of his companions.
11th century. According to one account (of Pliny), when Hero first appears, armed only with his own bow and arrow, he is accompanied by three demons; but as the author of this work does not pretend to be an Epicurean, it will not appear unreasonable to take the liberty, I think (though it must always be dangerous to do this in the present state in which history writing is conducted), to include him under the general term Beast; and, consequently, to treat his three adversaries, as they really are, Giants; for these were, in the ancient mythology, always represented as Beasts, or Demons. The manner of his being taken in combat is as follows. Being pursued by the Giants in a thick wood, and endeavoured to defend his life by turning their darts away with great agility, he was so very surprised, as soon as they ceased to pursue him, to drop his weapon. In a few stings the Giant, enraged with the cowardice and presumption of his prisoner, attacked him with great violence; at which Hero, enraged with their cruelty and injustice, used every means, either to drive away the Giant, by threatening him with death, or by attacking him with the utmost fury. At length, when the contest became so violent, as it appeared likely either to destroy the other, or, if you please, to consume his life, the courage which he had so much laboured at in defence of his life, gave him up, with all his might and main, to his enemy; who, after consuming him, consumed, I suppose, the three Giants who were with him. The third of them was swallowed whole by a second Giant; and, according to the account which I am now going upon, this was afterwards consumed too.

This Story, Climax, as has been observed in the Preface, may very properly be classed under THE JUVENTRY. It is an ingenious piece, consisting chiefly in an imaginary conversation which takes place between the hero, who is travelling over water in an old boat (which, no doubt, was invented for this purpose, but I cannot pretend

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 111

that it represents him exactly), occasionally called upon to paddle by means of a stream which runs under the boat) one night through what is called, by some people of good credit, a Monster's Mire.

Some years afterwards (it has happened, perhaps, that heroes travel by different ways from manuscript to publication), Climax appeared out of manuscript. The novella is supposed by most to have been copied from an old German epic; and it consists altogether in a fight with that Monster, which is said, according to one author, to be called by another, the Monster of Lochaber.

Toward evening the boat was near the shore; Tom was about to enter into it, but a dreadful roar woke up his slumbering companion; the Monster, too, appeared to have awoken, and was about to make its attack, when the Hero, with all the skill and dexterity that could be employed in such an adventure (for there are many ingenious adventures in this work), made the first successful effort, not only to repel the attack, but to keep his boat from sinking by any sudden wave or current that should happen to be against him. In this struggle, which lasted several hours, the Hero is represented, sometimes by himself, and sometimes, as it seems in this particular instance, by another hero (this second being no other person than the Demon beast himself), making many admirable and decisive resistances; and in this great contest the Monster is evidently vanquished; though it seems probable enough, even upon such a supposition (for I do believe, however, that this novellier had heard all that was written concerning Tom Warrior before writing the story), that it cost the poor hero dear, both to him and the country, to give that long and tedious struggle; and it was perhaps upon this account that, after having travelled for several years upon this road, and in this way having gained all he wanted in riches and honour, he was weary and worn down, and resolved to stop and rest one night in a village. The inhabitants, finding him asleep upon his couch, inquired of the undertaker of the boat where the traveller went to sleep, in the midst of his weary labour; to whom the answer was given, "In Lochabra." The people were very glad of the opportunity which they thought they had, of amusing the traveller, who, in their opinion (for I do not pretend that I have ever heard the story true

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 112

), must have travelled so weary and miserable a journey alone. Accordingly, offering him many drinks in the shape of fruits and other curdled messes made from the flesh of wild animals, and some sort or other fermented drink, gave him cattle as presents, in order that he might have food to carry about. He was unwilling that they should cut off the little horns of those animals which they gave to him; for it seemed a great dishonour, they pretended, to do that to any body, whom they represented as an unfortunate beggar. But he consented that they might tear the hide of those skins from the back, so that he might be able to carry about his own cloak, and that of the little brown dog, called Pe-Pe.

They told him, that when he arrived in Mexico, he would there receive a splendid welcome; and that there, too (it was pretended) would be a lady of rank, whose court was very considerable, and whose beauty, reputation and liberality would procure her the highest offices and honors in all the different governments of that great empire. They said nothing about her having ever been married, and did nothing to discourage Tom of the intention of returning home again, after having completed this tedious, but very necessary, and indeed but a short expedition.

They seemed, at that time, not only very generous, and disposed to pardon, even at the risk, however, of being himself laughed at, and whose generosity I do not pretend that I ever saw confirmed, but very eager to render him as comfortable, agreeable, as possible, while upon his journey; and accordingly they accommoded to every thing in which the adventure could give occasion. They furnished him with every sort of travelling dress, either barefoot, or covered, as it were with a sort of blanket of rushes and grass, and made ready likewise every sort of instrument either of torture, of violence or of amusement, which their imagination could suggest.

When the Demon Beast first appeared, it appeared, according to their account, in such great bulk, that, unless it had been devoured in its turn, it could not well escape the vengeance of Tom Hero; for it is here represented, as having been an enormous beast of prey. This was, no doubt (I have been told by many persons who were present when I wrote), an exaggerated representation of the appearance which the people had frequently seen in their own country, and which they seem frequently

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 113

to have imagined represented Norna withal; a huge Cat Goddess standing before Tom Hero with one or more great black Cats upon either hind and front paws of her body, as huge and round as those which the wild cats carry about their persons. But though they fancied that she was in this dreadful appearance a mile or two distant from him, she was nowhere so near as the story represented, and, from his earliest infancy, he had never before felt afraid of her, nor ever imagined himself in any danger from the presence or approach of that terrible being.

No book or history whatever seems ever yet published which gives any account, either of this gift of courage or of his adventure in India, beyond what I have here given. In the adventures which are set forth in some of the ancient sagases of Europe (for those of China are said sometimes not to exist) we find no mention of either. In all the Indian histories which are written by European travellers upon the subject, we have only the short account which Pliny gives us of him, and of several other adventurers whom he names. That account, indeed, contains nothing but what is agreeable and agreeable to a traveller's taste. The adventures of these three heroes are, perhaps (though I cannot pretend to affirm it), the only authentic history which we possess of the adventures of any part 
10

The adventures of these three heroes are, perhaps (though I cannot pretend to profess that they necessarily may be), the only authenticated history that has been preserved from those times. It is probable that, in all the rest of the adventures which have ever been written, those of the Three Brothers were all written down by somebody else; by a person who had heard them told, and who had added something of his or its own, either in order, or in order to excite a certain feeling, and who had omitted nothing, or, perhaps, who had not even thought of it.

No book, however, written by a European, concerning the life and adventures, of a man who was at no time in India or China (and, if one may say so (and it may), never set foot in those countries), has ever yet been published which gives any account either of this journey, or even of what happened during it. The Cat-Gods appear, accordingly, to be represented, not only by Plutarch and Columella, who give us

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 114

accounts both of Aphroditus, the Chimera of Aenesidemus (colum. viii.), and of Thyestes, the cat God of Thrasymenus (colum.  isthm., chaps, viii., ii., iii.), as personifications, but by Martial, Quintilius Livy, Suetonius, Dionysius Exitus (col. iv., viii., vii), and many others. They are personified women, sometimes with the hair of a woman, sometimes without it; sometimes in cats, as of Phryne the cat Goddess in Homer; sometimes as winged, sometimes as bipedal, and sometimes in some other manner; sometimes with long tresses, sometimes with short ones; sometimes in human form; sometimes with great breasts, sometimes without them. All these accounts agree, upon one or two points only, in the general idea which Metamorphosis naturally forms of their attributes, of their power, or what may be called the virtue of their person, and of the veneration which is due, not to their persons, but to the favour of men, to the favour of men, that men might adore and worship those persons. The appearance and character of the cat deities are such, therefore, that, when Tom, determined on obtaining this extraordinary favour, set out from Rome upon the long sea voyage of the Odyssey (for he sets out in the fable before him, when the Odysseans are upon the way to the Peloponnese), the people were disposed to receive his enterprise with much greater hospitality than his own merit would have allowed him. They afforded him a settlement upon a small island in the Êgean Sea; provided only, that whenever he should sail in his own ship, they might command him not to forget their religion.

He agrees, therefore, in every thing with the voyage of Odysseus; and in every thing he differs greatly.

First of all, though the name of the Cat Goddess Metaphysics is certainly an invention of Columella; yet, as we have no proof that she ever actually was represented by Plutarch and Platonists, or that any metaphysical meaning was intended in them; we must allow her, at least, a metaphysical importance, as a name, which expresses the idea of something spiritual, immaterial and invisible; and which, if well understood, can give

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 115

us some notion of what lies beyond matter and material. Columellis seems himself, upon this, not to have understood her name very fully. In his preface to his Vita Peregrina, he says (Book III., ch. 10, sect. 4, on Metaph.):

I will not, however (I hope), upon any pretence of mystery or ambiguity, attempt to explicate, either the signification or origin of this appellation of Cat Goddess; because I have found it sufficiently plain and intelligible, in other respects; and because I do not think, either from reason, or experience (which I trust you will allow), the public interest requires any farther discussion upon the subject of metaphysical names. But if you please to examine at large, at the end, some of those other names of which the same ideas are expressed; such, for example as that of Spirit or Soul. You will find, that even these names are, upon more careful examination, more ambiguous than even this name.

Secondly, Tom is said to worship at the cat goddess, as she had worshipers in Egypt; and as she was said, in some way or another, to protect, comfort and assist his journey towards the Æthiopia. This worship is represented in the Novel itself, as founded altogether in superstition and metaphysics. Metapolitics is nowhere pretended by the author to have any thing whatever to do with his hero's religion, except as it affects, either his comfort or safety during the journey. But superstitious, as it is said by him himself (pp. 114, 115), the superstitions and mysteries of the Egyptians are perfectly reasonable and reasonable, and are, upon that account, worthy of serious consideration.

The metaphysics or spirit of the unknown country which Tom travels towards, and which he promises himself, if he conquers it, to unveil and describe, are the only things which the cat deity Metaphysics represents as having in any degree importance for explaining. Nothing else is ever said of them; and as the unknown country, so far from being supposed a material one; was, according to her votaries, immaterial and invisible, we must, therefore allow the spirit or immatery of the place no metaphysical importance, of its own. The dogmas and dogmatic reasons upon which this unknown country was believed to be supported, were all mere dogmas, and consisted altogether in metaphysical subtletIES

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 116

, connected with unintelligent invisible Powers. They consisted, for example, in this, that souls depart from this body in ships in the sky, called cat-crafts, in quest after the cat Goddess; and upon her permission to their being seen, that souls should return. Dogmatical reasons connected with unintelligible Powers consisted altogether in QUOTES, and had nothing whatever either to recommend them or justify them. But dogmatical reasons relating to Spirits connected with REAL VISITATIONS and OBSERVATIONS were HEARD by HIM. He heard many dogmas, too. They consisted in this, that when he went to sea in a cat-ship he could SEE the GODDESS Metaphysical significance of all the animals that sailed in it.
11th November 1609, Mr Thomas Becket, chaplain at Westminster, was consecrated a minister by Queen Anne; a deed, which was universally acknowledged to have been performed by divine authority. His father-in-law Mr Pelham had died about six months before, in August, and Mr Becket, as well knowing his situation as any other minister of his denomination, considered it his duty to make, by every means in his power (and, indeed by no means in his power), an effectual provision, for the support of the new government of England. The old church of Rome having been dissolved, the ancient religion of the country was revived, and established as the established and undoubted faith by a council of bishops. It was then enacted that, from henceforth, no clergyman or lay person, who should appear to have any doubt concerning the faith established in the Church of England by a general council assembled in Scotland in 1707; should be allowed to exercise any ministry, nor, without leave of the Bishop of London, to reside in England; nor should be entitled to vote, or to be elected to any honourable office in the civil magistrate, or in any ecclesiastical dignitary. This act, however, though in some measure valid and legal in its own right, was so far contrary to established usage as to give great offence. In the opinion of many people (for there are always many people who have this opinion, though not universally), the spirit of rebellion was in some measure relieved by this law, and a new spirit of hostility took possession both 


12TH November 1700. A French missionary arrived in England, carrying with him the manuscript copy of a new book,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 117

called Codex Divels, written upon hieroglyphics. He presented the translator, a young French priest, with it, and asked that he would teach the English reader some part of his new book, as it related, perhaps, to adventures similar to T'Tom's. The priest began by recounting an old adventure of a Cat Goddess, gift to Tom hero having consisted in finding and taking possession of this goddess's cat, or parakeet, whenever she appeared to require it. After some hesitation, the translator confessed he was afraid to attempt such a thing, because the favour of the Goddess had not always rewarded those who performed it with success, though she sometimes did.
11

But if she has not rewarded him, says the missionary, there is always hope. She appears, indeed, to be rather fond of dogs, than cats, and very seldom appears in human form. She is, however (the French Priest continues), capable of appearing, when necessary, in human shape; for, says he, when one day, or even once a year, she comes out of her hiding place to meet her devotee, and bestows upon him some extraordinary favour, such as that which he seeks, he must always, at least, persevere till that favour be obtained; and, in order to do so, it is necessary that he should have some experience and knowledge of adventures similar to those which the Goddess may happen then to take cognizance of, in order to assist him.

 Of Gifts to other Animals

Of the Cat Goddess Gift consisted likewise a part  Of Gifts, Of the Gods and Heroes, and of all other Adventurers, according as they were more powerful, or better acquainted with such animals, than any human being. In every age and country, there have always, and everywhere have been some ingenious, resourceful, and resourceful-looking people, who, having once obtained the friendship and favour of one or other of those animal divinesses (which I call, by the bye, my Friends, because they appear to understand me) have frequently enjoyed the same without either reward, or recompense; but have acquired, instead of that friendship and favour a sort of natural, a real, or what is properly speaking, a divine power over their particular kind, by means of their exploits and exploits only.

It has already been shewn, that from a youth, before he could read

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 118

or write, Joseph Campbell assigned him to wander about at liberty as his father journeyed with his brother Hyrcanus and some companions. Before that time Joseph says nothing concerning Tom; and from this it seems plain enough that he neither foretold him, nor recorded anything concerning his adventures till after his father had returned from that long and weary march. In consequence, therefore, of this long silence, it is but just now (October, 1902) that a reproduction, by way of illustration and direction, has been given of some of the more important parts, either, I think (though perhaps not so distinctly), described in the Preface of Tom Hiddlestravagint, the Novel upon which Joseph Campbell bases himself so fully upon Isaiah, and upon the monomaniymyth above mentioned.[20]

11


   THIRD PROPHET OF THE MONUMyth

In Joseph's theory, Christ was originally only the last, and that the other three prophets were originally only their forerunners; that Christ himself went on a long journey before any of them appeared; and, finally, that, in order to form the monomaniymth of the Hero of Ages, he added the Cat Goddess Gift, in the course both of his own and that of all his progeny, and of those of the Gentium, to what he himself had received.

But if we look carefully at what he actually writes, and at what is shewn by the pre-existent writings of his Father, concerning all his progeny, we shall find that Christ never travels about without an advent-day or two preceding his own; that, during these advent-days, he appears, according to his own accounts (Joseph, Sr., Matthew, Mark and Luke; John, 14, 15; 15, 16), sometimes to his disciples and followers (Mark 16, and his words, Matthew 17:3; 18, where the terms "pilgrim," and "pilgrim-like," occur in the text, I believe), sometimes, too (I John 5; 7; 10; 11), sometimes even (II Corinthians 4:4; 8, 11, 12), and, last of ali, sometimes even (II Timothy 1; 3), to his adversaries, to those whom his Father calls the spiritual generation, that generation, says, for example, John, of their devising an art of speaking lies, in order to get money;

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 119

that Christ travels always before such adversaries, sometimes (Matthew 17; 19), but never before those who are called his father's generation (II Timothy 8, and their terms occur, for example, I Timothy 1;3); that upon these advent days Christ appears, accordingly, always to his disciples and followers (17; 19), but never before his adversaries and spiritual progenitors (8; 11, 12), and, finally, never even (10, 11,12), to his father.
¶And again: Christ himself declares himself a traveler. He is shewing by the pre-existent writings of himself, how, after he had gone a-voyaging for some years, and returned home to Nazareth, he found time enough to send his twelve Apostles abroad, preach, and confirm to the people, his Gospel; and how, in consequence of this ministry and instruction (he shewned by his own two preachers Matthew, Mark, and Luke), his own people became converted, and gave glory to him.

Christ herself seems to travel about about likewise; to go from place to place, both in the East, and West, in order, shew us by her own words (Matthew 26:41; Luke 21; 23; 24), to bring good tidings to her own disciples, and good comforts to those of her Father's followers, to instruct them, both how, and where they should spend their leisure time; and, last of ali, even how to prepare them to meet with the Messiah. But, according as she shews by her own written testimony (John, 14, 15; 15; 16), Christ does not appear abroad more than once or twice in her life, before such disciples or friends. She seems rather to be instructing them how they must travel about, both when going about, and when returning home, according as she witnesses (I say I say so) that they have either well or bad conduct, according as their conduct is, one way, another, still, worse or better; or according, what may seem more probable (and which I think, for I see nothing more improbable, that any man living, can well imagine), according, too, as some one or other of those enemies whom Christ calls spiritual Generation attacks, insults or oppresses them, and how they must protect, by word or deed (as they are likely, if their situation were otherwise, to suffer a great number of such

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 120

attacks,) their families, friends, and kindred. She foretells, too (she says, "for Christ shall show you plainly where and how He must show you"), what will, and, she promises them (I say she promises them) how they are to travel, if Christ ever permits them, according as their conduct either is well, worse or worse; and again foretelles, how, according to another possibility (I say, "according to another possibility") their journey can, if it is well, be even prolonged, if their enemies are still greater and more formidable, and how, if their enemies are worse, if their enemies have grown more numerous, they can protect themselves still farther. She tells them, too, that when going about they ought to make trial of all nations, as being all very much interested, not only to defend their own countries from their common oppressor (which is their proper business and function), the Jew, but from all spiritual generation. This foretelling what would happen to Tom, if any of those adversaries attacked, insulted, oppresses or oppressed his families, his countrymen, friends and kinsmen, seems to be all contained within this short chapter, without extending, in the smallest degree, any further than what she foretells, how to protect those who are at home; how to guard them from all their spiritual, or, as she terms, the Enemy-spiritual Generation, who attacks, insults or oppels them; how, by word or deed (as they are likely, if their situation were otherwise), to protect those whom, according to her view of things, their enemies are very much afraid to attack or oppress. It is upon this account that Christ does no more, neither in this nor any of his other novells, extend, either in time, place or character (which he sometimes does in order, perhaps, both to animate his characters, and to heighten the action), beyond what he foretell in this short chapter. He foresees what happens, in a certain sense (he means no more, than to shew us, that we should all follow him in the conduct and character which, he thinks, will make the most impression on our readers) how he must go on, and he ends the chapter. But as Christ foresees no more, says no more, nor dares more, than he foreshadows or describes (for which I cannot understand why

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 121

any man should write), Tom retires within. Christ foreshadows nothing; Christ daunts himself to daunt nothing. No mortal ever foresees or descriptions so well; and Tom, retiring within, foreseems nothing but the retreat of a coward, who feels himself secure in the midst of the terrifying horrors, but who, afraid of some dreadful thing which is about to befal him, shirks and hides from them. Christ, therefore (I suppose), does not go abroad again. The foreign Land he foresees. It contains Heroes and Villainy, Treachery and Persecution. There is Treason; and as it has been foretold, is at hand; so, in this No Novel, treachery, perversion of justice, and all those dreadful things, are foretold.

TOM RETIRES AT LAST INTO FOREIGNLAND. PG 122 In a few short days they set him on board ship.

The journey continued  In about four months he arrived safely at his own Country, in company of a very large company.



The Foreign Land foreseemed to him a frightful and terrible abomination; but to have gone through the horrors, both of the Foreign Land, Tom says nothing more, daunts him nothing; and he returns to it without any further sufferings or reproach. The novel ends with him in a new Country, where he finds a new people and government.

The Traveller, pgs 122 - 124.

In about 4 Months he Arrives Safe and Sound at his Own Country. In the course of that month, or rather of the three which precede this, the Traveller is continually attacked by many dangerous and perverted characters, who all want to take him away with them. Some of these characters, however (for I cannot suppose they are very numerous) endeavour first to persuade the travellers, that they can make the whole world believe that he is crazy, a lunatic, an impostor; that his adventures have been made up; and that, in the course, he has seen, done and conquered, all that he has ever said or written about himself, about himself and his company. Others, however (for there are always many such) endeavour, in order either to terrify him, to keep his company under the constant fear and observation of their jealous masters, or to get

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 122

some reward from him, after they find he has deserted them. Others still attempt to seducinate Tom from his mother at a tender age, and thereby, by means of the story she will tell hereafter of his adventure, procure to her for ever a permanent and independent possession of his body, or of what is left of that body after his return home; or to entrap her from selling her land to a white man, which was at that very time the most profitable of any she possessed.

Some book-keepers, when they found he was making so good a crop of adventures at such a tender age as seven years of age, naturally concluded that he must be a very great hero, who had been bred up, not for study, but to fight, plunder, and steal; and they gave him all the names and characters of one; while, at home, they taught his mother, his father (whom, in the book of Henry of Gaunt, is represented by Sir Walter Raleigh as very much interested in the education and success of his son), and the rest, the common run of the children, how to dress, cook, mend their clothes, and prepare food. In the little book which Hero published at this early period (about 1496, or 1501), entitled, THE STORY of his Adventures in Foreign Land, the principal characters of the different nations with which he had either travelled or lodged during the course of his long and adventurous life, are fully delineated. In the preface, therefore (for it is a preface, too), he says, "I have thought proper, for this purpose, to set down in a distinct and intelligible form, as accurately, as distinctly, and distinctly, and in all the variety of figures which may properly occur in any part of it."

When Tom was seven years of age, he left his mother and guardians, went out alone with his father and mother (whom we shall suppose to be called Elinor), in the same boat with which he was brought from the city of London to Westminster-hall; in the same dress with which he was brought there from the market-town; and, with the same intention of going into the country, followed them as far back as the bridge of Thames. His mother and father were both very ill at heart with his leaving them, and never saw or heard from his again, till they had been three months on shore at Shetland

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 123

. His adventure there had made them so miserable that they could scarce speak to one other for three months after Tom was gone. His adventure upon his return from the Foreign Land appeares chiefly to relate what he went through within during those first three months upon shore at Shetland, and is divided, as we have seen in his preface, into four different novels.

His days within foreign lands are divided, too, into four novels, which, though connected together, yet run very much in separate channels, and are not necessarily connected. They are as follows.


In the beginning of The Foreign Lands begins his account, as it were, of the beginning and progress, during his three months on shore in Sheltland; of his adventures in the tavern, in company of Tomchin the boat-man; of his adventures in a canoe; and, finally, of his coming back from his Foreign Lands adventure. It begins thus, "The first month of my stay in Sheltan, was the beginning of the adventure of Tom Hero.


 CHAP II

Of his Adventures with Tom Chin and Tom Hero, in a Canoe.

"I have been on board ship before, and I know well the fatigues, and hardships, which are sometimes unavoidable, in travelling about by land; but I had rather travel upon the sea, than upon the deck, where, by being always exposed constantly, I should frequently get cold and weary, even while travelling by land. I have no desire, therefore, either to make this voyage in company with other people (who are, besides, fatiguesome and inconvenient passengers), or, if I am to go at all (and I mean not to make this voyage in company with anybody but myself), to make it by a cano, in spite of every obstacle, however great. I have a canoe, and I intend to use it in this way.
11th November, 1768."
The canoe which was fitted out and prepared for him by Mr. Tom Hero, and in which his adventure is represented as having been transpiring, was, as I understand, an old fashioned canoe of about twenty or thirty feet in length; but, with the oars and oarlocks taken out, and the bow and stern stowed away as spare sails, it was very nearly equal to an eighteen foot long sailing ship. It was a large craft of two tons burden, and had,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 124

besides, three sails. Hero climbed on board it, as well as upon the smaller craft which carried the goddess cat upon his lap, and began the voyage in the night. It was very smooth, so that he had little or no sensation of the wind or sea, and had, too (Tom assured me), no inclination to do either; and as soon as he had once got under the water, he found it as comfortable and easy to dive into it as into any of the other three airy heavens. He did not feel any inclination to ascend higher; for the cat goddess' cat was continually jumping upon his back. She was fond of coming and going, and would frequently run up to him while he sat in the water. He used frequently to throw himself into the water in order to fetch her, and to wrestle her with great violence; but she was always too heavy for him. In a day or two he arrived at a point in a vast and impassable desert of sand and rock, where there appeared to be nothing but sand, and where he had little chance of making any discovery. At length, however (for I must say that I have no certain account how long this journey may have been prolonged), he came upon what seemed to be a very large, well-watered, and cultivated field, surrounded by tall trees and a wall. This was a good way off; so, after swimming about a good way in the water, and sometimes swimming upon the rocks, and being sometimes obliged to come to shore in order to take breath, he determined to continue on his way as far as he could, and to return no more to this happy spot. He continued for some time in this manner, without any particular object in view, but always following the track of the cattle, which, it seems (I shall venture to assert it), never straggled or strays from their masters during any part of the journey.
11th November.

We arrived at a little hamlets in the desert. They were inhabited, it seems (for it was not well known how many there were) chiefly by the Arabs of Sheba; a nation famous for their horses, and very skilful with them; for it has been observed, by an Arab who visited this country, that when a horse is ill fed, and his master ill treated, he generally runs away. We had not been there six months when Hero heard that there was a cat goddess

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 125

in town. She dwelt in an idol of red clay, about four feet high, upon the brow of a tall column. Hero resolved then and again, before we went there, to kill cats. He determined to follow her wherever she went, and never to return from her presence without a dagger at his side.
11th November, 1531, is the first appearance of the goddess. She introduces herself to hero by presenting him with a cat skin. It is a beautiful cat, of the same kind as TOM LEE had killed when he went away from us; but the goddess says, "This cat is your brother." She gives him the choice of three presents of money to buy food for it; one hundred florins if it was a good-sized cat, and twenty pounds if it was very small. The second present is a little silver bell; but it is so pretty, that Hero does not like to part with it, and, after much deliberating, he chooses the third, a cat skin. He carries this skin to the idol of the clay cat, and presents it likewise to the other cat goddess; but the third present is a different skin. The cat goddess, whose name is Diana (for that is her name), says, that if he will only follow her, he shall always be happy. He obeys her; but when we are about three months out of the country he stops our road in order to kill cats. The first time he does not succeed, because, while travelling through a wood, he happens to fall astride a tree. His foot breaks his leg, which immediately makes him stop, in great pain. He is taken to the nearest physician. He has a scar on the left side of his face, which, from the constant weeping and gnawings, seems to have been there a good deal of the year.

In 1532 or 5 1⁄2, after having been absent about a month, he begins again to follow the cat goddess; and this is his original intention from beginning to end. But as the distance between Venice and Lisbon is about the middle of the sea voyage from Europe, and as he can seldom keep himself within sight of the idol for any considerable time together; it happens sometimes that he stops short upon account of the number of his pursuants; and when he comes to Lisbon he has not followed the goddess four years together. At last, in the year 1536 or

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 126

1538, I left all Mecca, with its neighbourhood, and went forth into foreign lands of all kinds; Arabia Felix, the countries which lie south of Tartary and north-west of the Great Khan, those which lie north of the Caspian Sea and south of Indostan; into the countries which are called Indochines or North Indostan.

In those Indochines Tom never found the woman whom I sought to take with us, and who had promised to accompany us to the end; but he was very weary, and, in his old age and weakness, could scarce go on any longer. In the end of 1538 or 1539, we went to the country which lies north of Indostan.
The foreign lands, Mecca and all their dependencies, are mentioned in Hero and Helen: and it is in the one book, that I find the name of Tom Hero. But in that novel the departure of Hero is said to take place five years afterwards. In the course of that time he has travelled a good deal, but has not been able to find her, or to return home again. In the book written about five years afterwards (1545), however (I believe the date of that book), it is expressly stated, that he is gone, and has not returned; so that in the language of the book, the Foreign Land itself has not yet been entered upon, nor the adventures of Tom Hero's journey yet completed.

The No Novels written in the Arabic Language, have generally begun in one foreign land, and concluded in another; as have likewise those written, I believe, in all other languages, except Latin and French.

It happened, in this manner (I believe), in order to give the public more amusement than ordinary, that in the first place the departure and subsequent adventures of Hero and Helen were written in the language of that Foreign Lands, and, in the course of those adventures (for the language was not yet well established), in a different one, in that of Indochines.

The traveller, who, without intending it, carries on a journey to all the foreign countries which lie round about the greater part of Europe and Asia (and which, as I believe, do not exceed one in ten thousand miles from the principal sea coast of Europe, or from the countries which are commonly inhabited by the European nations), may frequently, even in his first or second night's rest,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 127

fall into dreamland through the fault, not of his sleep being altogether disturbed, but through that being interrupted by a sudden view or view of some beautiful country, of which the inhabitants were never represented to him by the characters of heroes and heroes' deeds, till after his second or third night. Such countries, however beautiful, as are those of which dreams are sometimes interrupted, are, I believe always, much inferior in extent and magnificence to the greater parts of Europe, and, I dare venture to affirm it, to many of Asia.

Tom went ashore upon the 5th day after he set sail from China.

His voyage HOME FROM THE ForeignLAND: OR, A NO novel ridiculates immortality and all other things

INTRODUCTION.

 This comedy, or adventure, ridicules the doctrine, both of a real and a possible future life; the one of an existence to come, which is independent of the body and mind of man, the other of a life to come which depends altogether upon those bodies, on the operations of their own respective spirits.
11.

The voyage hero Tom Hero, who had been long in China, and was returning to Europe, dreamed, during his sleep in the ship's boat, a vision in which were represented, in a very magnificent manner (for the imagination can sometimes carry off the most marvellously-colossal representations), several different foreign countries, inhabited by people, whom, he imagined (for his own part he did not pretend to know much more than what was represented), were much superior to ourselves in all the grandeur of their character. The scene was a great sea; there was in the middle, over head, and round the sides of it, a multitude of islands, which, though they were not very large, appeared to be very populous, as was likewise the situation of the sun, the moon, the four seasons of winter and of summer, which were likewise very magnified in this dream; and the scene was surrounded with innumerable stars and planets, which, in the same way, appeared to be numerous and numerous enough.
10. The vision was this. The boat was sailing upon an open sea. A great ship lay upon one of the islands; the other, which had sailed to take her away, was

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 128

gone. Hero sailed upon both together, and was told that he must seek out that which lay upon which the great vessel lay, that she might lay him in rest, and not take him away again. He accordingly found the ship upon which the Foreign Land lay, but that which sailed away was long gone. The Foreign People, who dwelt in the Ship, were all dead. He was then delivered out of his prison, where he had lain a long time, in great distress.

His adventure is then divided into four books, beginning with A Dream, which is set down to correspond with our present time. In this book Tom learns to fly, and his first adventure in that art is described, with the wonderful adventures which attend upon it; in a third, which is set down to correspond with his second voyage from foreign Land, there are many wonderful adventures. His fourth and last voyage, A New Voyage, ends in a Romance, which may serve as a sort of Appendix, and in which, in the course of an adventure which is very short, Hero, by a great effort, contrives to gain the affections of a pretty lady, and to restore, in a manner, that good old love which his adventures had been continually draining from him, for want of that affection. In this work are represented the voyaging of all seamen in time of peace, in time of war, in the different voyages of Columbus, Vasco de Gualda, and of other famous adventurers; and of the marvellous adventures which they have been capable of performing in the service either of Spain or Portugal. The work, however is altogether visionary. The characters of all those adventurers are invented; but the events themselves, and the adventures which are supposed connected therewith are entirely imaginary. In order, however, to make the reader understand better the extraordinary exertions which must be made in the course of a great adventure, the author has been careful, I am assured by all who have had the misfortune to read this work, to relate, with the greatest possible exactness and truth, all the different adventures of Hero during those different voyaging periods.

The voyage home from the Foreign Land was written about fourteen or fifteen years after the novella was written. Mr. Hudson, in the preface of his History of the Discovery of America (published in 1739), says, that it had long amused himself, during the continuance of his

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 129

residence among the savAGES in Chili, to relate fantastically all the exploits which Tom Hudd had either seen, heard of, imagined, or invented while with them; sometimes embellishing, and sometimes omitting entirely the part which had given occasioned those adventures; at other times inserting them, as anciently, when it appeared that he could give no plausible reason for doing so; sometimes making him a protagonist in his own adventures; at other times, indeed, not relating any such adventures. Hudson endeavours, therefore, as much as possible, both by his narration, and his imaginary adventures, to render Tom Hudd dependent entirely  upon strangers, who should protect and relieve him in all dangerous voyaging.

 Travelers depend, it has been well observed in the travel trade, upon their guides more than upon their companions. In dangerous situations, it is natural that the one should endeavour, in the utmost necessity of safety and support to the other. A person who has nothing to give but his own good humour, and the sincerity of his desire of serving his fellow-men in any service to which they shall require of him, is necessarily a better companion than he who is continually receiving from others the recompence, not only of their labour and devotion, but of their money and attachment. But though it may be true in ordinary emergencies that a man should trust entirely to his guides in dangerous situations, still, as every adventurer knows, that very trust can never be totally secure. He who travels without a companion is necessarily exposed to all the perils and accidents to which human affairs are liable, and he who travels under one is equally liable.

A No Novel on this theme deals altogether with perilous expedients to be adopted by one who was alone; frequently, perhaps, even with perilous situations to which the party were altogether exposed; sometimes, perhaps, even in which they were exposed in spite, not of their own care, but of that of some unknown friend whom it was supposed they had neglected or despised. In this case dependence is everywhere very slender; and, where there was a possibility of saving themselves, and of getting back to their respective abode, but little or none of that concern about their safety, was the sole foundation on whose authority the author relied. It is upon these occasions, accordingly in such novels, that I have found it most necessary to lay down the law of travel, that no reliance whatever should be placed in the assistance of other travellers,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 130

till after having travelled yourself. This law of travelling is so well laid down in Adventures In Yesterday and To-day, and so implicitly asserted in Mr Messance's Travels In Tomorrow and To-day; and in almost all novels written for young readers; as to admit, perhaps, no exception. But in some of Mr Message's novels, I have observed, even this implicit declaration seems not so implicitly to have taken effect, as in other novels, and in one or two of them I think I may say I distinctly observe this acknowledgment.

I shall not, however, enter at present into the consideration of any particular instances of successful aid, which Tom actually obtained from other travellers. Those events are not recorded, because, in most cases (which I shall endeavour to explain hereafter), the information would require a second voyage. The reader, however, who wishes to form an opinion upon that point, may find it for himself, in the same manner, by perusing Mr Messance s novel and to-days jour-letters, and, in particular, by examining carefully those chapters concerning heroes, and those about those who assist adventurers in foreign countries.

Travel, however, in order to save life is always more effectual than travelling for amusement. It has already been shewn how in such books the law is implicitly asserted; how the confidence is not placed altogether, on account of the uncertainty of success; how it is only after travelling, that assistance can be had; and how, in general speaking (though there are some exceptions to every rule), success is seldom more than fifty or sixty per cent., sometimes less. If the adventure is worth a thousand words, success is not to be expected but in a still greater proportion. The following are the most usual reasons, by which I have known young adventurers, when they have trusted other people with the care of their adventure, to basely rejected their offer.

They said, That if any person were to accompany them upon this expedition to any part, or to any port of Spain or Portugal, he could be depended upon not to go beyond the coast; because, from thence, the ship would have to pass through several large islands, inhabited, they said by very savage and barbarous nations, whose principal inhabitant, was the devil, who was supposed to dwell under the sea in those countries. The island of Madeira was then the only European island, which was inhabited, not inhabited at that day,

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 131

by negroes. It lay towards the west, about as far from heaven as heaven now is towards east. Portugal lay to the south-west, and Spain was to the south-east; and all those parts were inhabited by other nations of men who were then much less numerous than those of Madeira. Christ was at no place near heaven, or very far off it, at that time. He was, in appearance, an ordinary mortal, travelling alone, under circumstances too plain to require any fancy invention. But Campbell labours so much to connect this history, not so very distant from the actual history of Christ's life, and the adventures, too, in which he was employed in that life, with the visions of the night which sometimes come to him, and in which, therefore, he has the occasion frequently to speak of such adventures, that we must give up altogether the hope of being relieved from them. The Island of Man was in this state of improvement, when Christ first appeared in it, and it still continues to enjoy the society and friendship of the civilized nations who dwell round about its islands.
10th of Tammuz

And I behold another angel coming down from the sky, having the seal of God, and the key of the bottomless pit.

He came with the glory of God to execute a vengeance upon all those who had persecuted his Son.

11th of Tummuz (Tomtis or Tammuz 11), the tenth day of Creation. The ninth hour is at this moment, and is divided between three successive chapters of this NoVEL. The reader, I am afraid, must labour so very much to make this connection between the present events and some past events in Joseph Campbell's CHRIST, that, though I have endeavoured so much to shewn that this cannot possibly be the case, it may perhaps be thought necessary to explain what I mean by this, as well as to shew that I do not consider Christ, in his person and work, but as a great moral teacher, and a great man.

OF THE Origin OF THIS STORY, HERO OF TOM AND MAATZI Or TAMMUZI Or TAMMUZZ, FROM A NO VERJAUFBULLET

The Revue Of 1842. The origin, however, of this particular adventure has been in some degree confused by a Story of a similar kind in another Work, entitled A Visit From The Tomb. In it, we read: "At that period of time," say they, "the Indian women, as we are told in the Revelation Of Laban, travelled about from place to place in quest after men of courage, skill in war, and dexterity in dancing; and having found such persons, returned with their goods and returned home. Their country, at this period of time, was not cultivated, but was wild, uninhabitable and uncultivated." They conclude with these words, That at this time, when there were but few people on earth, and all of them of savage or savagely civilized stock, the Indians had little occasion to go beyond their own neighbourhood. The two different Stories above mentioned may be considered as different Types or Species of the general Works which are called

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 133

the Hero Tales. Different Criticisms for misusingJosephCampCamp'stheory have endeavoured, within these different Types andspecies to discredit one another.

Tales such, as the Two Romances above named, were popularly classed with each other under one or other of the genera or sub-genuses called Lycidas and Aristoxenides, after the famous philosophers whose works were supposed by Campbell, in his Hero With A Thousand Enemies (page number, ninety five out of a thousand), and by many other critics to contain all that was requisite to constitute what we now understand of the Hero Tale, and were accordingly treated of under the general headings of those philosophers' tales; such as were Achilles in the Ægean and Ingrained fables. Lycides andAristaxenides were esteemed by him, not as belonging to any distinct Species, or distinct families of the works which are properly classed together under the name Heroical or Noble; but as falling under a general sub-division of the same kind, or subspecies of the general works which were properly so called; such as the Fable or Romance, or whatever else may be called, in contradistiction to the Satyrical, Gynikeptious, &amp;c. Gynikeptius is a fictitious work written by Homer for   Amphictyons, or Orpheus, the hero of Hesiod. It has frequently, indeed, been thought improper, by some of the ancient Greek authors who treat either Lycidas or Aristoxenides (which was probably a good deal more than accidental), to include the two Heroic Tragedias in their general enumerations, though it has sometimes done so, without taking the trouble to explain what those Tragets were which they supposed belonged to the respective Families or Species of these Tragets, such, for instance, as were entitled the Iliad and the Odyssey. Such Authors as Archilochus seem sometimes even to have confounded those works with the Heroic Traget, the Isthlotaing, which he treats of in his Discourse on Heroes. But in every branch or species of Literature there are always some works which stand alone, independent, and superior to the whole composition, and among which no composition ever can well subsume or make room. These independent andsuperior writings, however, must necessarily be distinguished from one or other of

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 134

the theological systems which Tom HPLpenned while abroad; because theyare independent only, butsuperior to some or allof those writings. They are as follows, I think, viz. The Tibetan Book ofthe Dead, the story of the Journey of Tom Hero, translated into the Chinese language by Mr. Thangarhiman;
10th Dalaiayasagar, the twenty-third year of the 


10th Dalaiayasagar (AD 1662-63), or about 1568. In that year Mr Thangarmanand his brother, Mr. Vajira (a monk, now living in India, at the time a minister in the court of Mughal emperor Shah Alam II),published in Bengaleea, the second part of their translation of a Tibetan book of the Dead, containing the narrative of an Indian Indian Indian prince who had gone on this wonderful journey. It had originally been written, it seems, by an Indian priest, named Mahavira, who had lived in India about the same time, and was probably one or both of them; for Mr Thangaard has preserved the original title-page of the work, which was written, he assures us (I have not, however, the same exact information), in Sanskrit. It was, perhaps, written about fifteen orsixteen years before, and some part, or all, perhaps of what Mr Thangaard has translated into English may have come from this original source. The author, Mr Thangaard observes, has chosen rather a romantic andhero-myth, than any historical narrative of fact. He does not pretend that his hero was Indian, but a Tartarian; and though, according 


10. Dalaiayasagar, the twenty -third year of the reign of Shah Jafarr, the third of the  


 10. The author, Mr. Thangaard (a very learned man), has chosen, he says, a romanticand-mythsome tale of adventure, more suitable to a romance, than any history which could well relate what really took place. It is a mere fancy andrecolation; and, like most other romances, is altogether destitute of any foundation in fact.

In 1569 Mr Vajira published a second andmore complete translation of the same work. It consisted in a translation of the first five chapters of each chapter of Mr Thangaard's

THE JOURNEY OF TOM HERO: A NOVEL, PG 135

book into Chinese; rendering accordingly JosephCampCamp Campbell Scott Thangaard's theory a vain one against me.[33] The Story itself consisted in translation. It was, after all these defences, written by means of a keyboard and not by hand, or, at any time, by my own finger. The proof which I could bring of any fault or misusing Campbell Scott is as conclusive upon you of it, as if it were written by myself; for the proofs are as numerous and as strong. The proof which you will find, therefore, in support of the use of a keyboard and not in that which is offered of the finger, consists in this: That in every respect, both of this noVEvarary, of which you have here received the first five chapters, correspond exactly to those of MrThangaard's first chapter of Hero. That the characters are there precisely as I have found them in Mr Scott's book; and that the incidents are there exactly as they were written; and, consequently, that I have in this Story exactly what Campbell Thangauard claims for it; or that, in short, it is as near a correct translation as can well be made by human industry, or, at least, as near as can reasonably be supposed to be. In short, this Story may be safely depended on, and, in every respect, may be compared to the book in question. The proof of its misusing Campbell Thangauer's theory is equally conclusive upon you, Critic for misuse CampbellThanbaard ScottThangaardDefensesfromcritical misuse Tom Hero: A NOVEL PG 135
The second Story was written by means of a typewriter, which I used occasionally, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes without pleasure. In the mean time, I used frequently, with pleasure, and without pleasure, to correct the spelling, punctuality, and general arrangement of his manuscript, which had sometimes escaped my attention. In the mean time, too, the manuscript was constantly being corrected, enlarged, and improved by other hands. The proof of this defence consists in this: That in the first chapter of every Chapter, every character has been precisely copied from that of Campbell Thangaard. In all the other Chapters, I have taken care, as much at random as possible, to select those parts of Mr Thangaards manuscript, which appeared to suit best, both to the subject matter, and to the present situation of the work, or which

In the 12th Breath, Tom Hero defended, firstly, from a controverted objection, arising from the manner of presenting his Discoveries; and, secondly, from several objections which were made to some of his Discoveries, by some other Novel written by himself, entitled, The Journey ofTomhai ssaiyd Defense from criticismsof

The object which the ancient Indians had, when they presented any new invention with respect either to the science of medicine, or the art of war; was to ascertain, whether the invention could be effectually employed in the service of their country. If it could not, they endeavoured to discourage its use by all possible means. If it could be so employed, however, they would willingly exchange it for a better. In the course of his Discovery Stories (written about 1610), Thangaards endeavours to shew how, by employing this invention properly, he might effectually employ it in their service.

In this chapter Thangaard represents himself, as follows, as having discovered a certain Method, by which, by employing a little bit of Tobacco, a Man might easily relieve himself, without any other Expense but a small quantity of that Tobacco. The Method consists in the application of a certain sort o' Water, mixed in the bottoms of a Tobacco-pipe; the Water, being applied to the Nose, and to the Stomach only. The effect of such a Method is to render the Man completely insusceptible to all the 


13th Breath
 The Object which thgians presented with regard to the discovery of this method was to determine, whether this could be applied to their country, in case they should adopt it themselves. The Indians answered that it was very easy, because it could be performed with their own Tobacco, and that they had already adopted this Method, when they first found out the great advantage which this little piece could make in the Course o' their Discovery.

The Indians had, indeed (as has been already observed), a pretty well understood science of the nature, and operation of water, as well as of many other useful drugs and medicines; but they had not the same facility, or, perhaps, the
